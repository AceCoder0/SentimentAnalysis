A crash course on how China is run In less than 300 pages, the book describes briefly but engagingly how various Chinese government departments operate, often in secrecy.  It answers questions like: who "elect" the General Secretary (currently Hu Jintao)? What does the largest human resourse department (The Organization Department) actually do? How does the Propaganda Department regulate the press? What is the relationship between the miliary and the Party (the CCP)? Is there a department devoted to investigating corruption in China? What exactly is the nature of "state enterprises"?Several case studies are presented for illustration including the 2008 milk scandal, Chinalco's buying a stake in Rio Tinto, contemparory cross-strait relations, the Shanghai Pension Scandal, etc.It appears that the Party is a behemoth that is continuously sharpening its statecraft, is ceaselessly evolving and demonstrates ingenous flexibility.
