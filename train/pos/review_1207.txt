Interesting read. An interesting read that presents a new view of the US issues with Asia. An easy read w/ much information not contained in other books on this topic. When reading historical accounts one is always left wondering about accuracy and if a personal agenda is involved and this book is no exception. It brings up much for discussion and thought and is an interesting and valuable contribution to our understanding of 20th century US activity world wide. I enjoyed the read!
