Another Revealing book on Corruption! “Big help with Little Badmouth!” Red Handed (RH) is the most recent entry into my library by Peter Schweizer.  I have found his works easy to read and understand. RH is no exception!  He is an outstanding writer and Harper is a “no mistake” editor.  Unlike a recent book I reviewed regarding Samuel Adams, I found the prose, sentence structure, and word selection not distracting from obtaining the full meaning of the story.In this work the author involves all aspects of American specialness which China has taken full advantage of to assist its regime to accomplish its geo-strategic goals at the expense of the United States (US).  From it it appears American elites have sold the rope to hang and hand the US to China.  The book exposes US citizens who have translated themselves and their companies’ services into lucrative operations helping Chinese firms while at the same time taking Beijing’s side in its trade dispute with undermining the US.Although this book has no photographs, it is very well constructed, it is well organized with a table of contents for its nine chapters, along with 20 % of the book reference material, and a fine, easy to use index.  After reading this most recent Schweizer piece I immediately sold all my positions of companies exposed in it and you should do the same.This is a magnificent book, in its reporting power, its meticulous research, its simple textual brilliance and chronological narrative.  RH stands “on the top” with other Schweizer contributions of the past.  If all the material referenced in this book is factual, then these stories of corruption make the films “Wolf of Wall Street” and “The Distinguished Gentleman” appear as child’s play!
