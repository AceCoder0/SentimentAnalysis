Most through book on China’s ambitious strategy I found this book a bit boring to begin with as what it discusses I have already known. But as I continue to read the more interesting I got . I found it well organised and well presented and best of all covers every angle of the issue in question , in much details .  It’s well written and is able to explain complicated matter with simple terms and vocabularies.  I have learned a lot and felt enlightens . I highly recommend this book to anyone who love America .
