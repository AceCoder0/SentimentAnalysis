To understand why China is a threat and what the US can do to counter it, read this book. I found Rush Doshi’s The Long Game: China’s Grand Strategy to Displace American Order fascinating as well as informative.  I’m no scholar of China or political strategy, yet I found his book to be very readable.He introduces topics using anecdotes that interest and illuminate.  For example, I found captivating his account of China’s clandestine purchase of a Ukrainian aircraft carrier, taking over 7 years to accomplish, costing tens of millions (in US dollars) including bribes, villas and casinos, and involving one basketball player.  This narrative illustrated how China in the 1990’s built up its military while hiding that effort.Doshi’s book is up-to-date.  He discusses how China perceives US weakness in dealing with the pandemic.  China’s response is to be emboldened.  Just look at last week’s events: China flying more than 100 jets over Taiwan as a show of strength.Doshi is organized and methodical. He makes a very convincing case that China is working towards displacing American liberal systems with their illiberal system.  He reviews different approaches to countering China’s ambitions and is persuasive that an asymmetric option is safest, least costly, and effective. If you want to understand why China is a threat and what the US and its allies can do to counter it, read this book.
