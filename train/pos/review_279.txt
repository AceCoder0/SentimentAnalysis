Alarm Bells This book is a real “eye opener”. It is evident that China is playing the long game and we have to recognize their strategy for what it is. Their ambitions to become the world’s most powerful super power are fueling their strategies to co-opt our government, steal our tech and infiltrate our education system. They care only about China and will do anything to achieve their mission. There is much we can and should do to combat their efforts. If not, we will hang ourselves with the rope  they sold us.
