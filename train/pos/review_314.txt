A Fine Piece of Research Peter Schweizer is a throwback journalist who knows how to dig for information and put it together in a readable form. This is the third book of his that I have read. All of them were excellent. He is not a partisan as he attacks both side of the political aisle equally and illustrates well that we are dealing with a bunch of “leaders” who care about themselves but not much else. China is a serious foe. We deserve better.
