I thought I knew a lot but..... I actually had to listening at different places to absorb all that the author was saying.  I had no idea the amount of corruption and how these so called elitists are selling out our country and the American people right along with it.  It seems that being millionaires is not enough, billionaires is not enough, ruling the world and power is where they all want and we the people are the "subjects"!
