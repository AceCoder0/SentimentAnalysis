The real truth about China, Japan Korea and U.S.A. A great eye-opener of a book dealing with the history of China and Japan, and how they got to be the economic powers they are today. This is not the history we were taught in school. The United States maneuvers when dealing with China, Japan and Korea are not fully commendable. You must read the details for yourself. The educational value of this book is priceless. Buy it A.S.A.P.!
