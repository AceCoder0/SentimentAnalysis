Ideology Trumps Reality This book is a keen, accurate depiction of how the ideologies of intelligent establishment men at the highest levels of our government blinded them to the realities of Asia's poor in the Phillipines, China, Korea and Vietnam. They ignored real information from our own experienced State Department experts in favor of myths foisted on them by corrupt, self-serving, foreign and American members of their own class. Their blindness cost hundreds of thousands of American, and millions of Asian lives. Such ideologically driven misconceptions and sheer ignorance of the our and the world's poor still dominates our  blundering political life today.  This book can afford insight into what's going on  between us and developing societies throughout the world today.
