Good read Got the book as a gift.  Loved most of Rutherfurd's other books but was never interested in China history.  It took me 2 weeks to get thru 1/4 of the book but it was getting better.  It's a huge, heavy book so I bought the Kindle version and I'm getting thru it much faster.  The 2nd half is better!
