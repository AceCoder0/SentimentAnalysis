May cause minor strokes. My mother got rushed to the hospital recently. She was very unwell. Slurred speech, confusion, and little to no motor function. After some testing in the ER and a cat scan, the doctors determined that my 81 year-old mother had a minor stroke. She eventually recovered and was released the next day. After talking with her about it, she told me that, and I quote, "The heavy topics and troubling information in this book were just so much to process that my reading of it triggered that little medical episode."So there you have it. Red Handed is so intense, it may cause minor strokes, according to my mom. Read at your own risk!I have not personally read it, but she said it was really good.I docked it one star for the whole stroke thing.
