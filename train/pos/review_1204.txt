Excellent research and well worth the read... Had my own opinion of Bradley's follow-up to the Imperial Cruise. I did read all the reviews to see what others took away from Bradley's conclusions and details of the foreign policy failures of both Roosevelts. They were for the most part, with a few exceptions, informative and provided additional insights into Bradley's research and conclusions. I do believe though, and some observers are correct that communists play the political game very well, that had TR not enabled the Japanese to the detriment of other Asian nations, and FDR hadn't been conducting his own shadow diplomacy...perhaps we could have avoided three wars (WWII, Korea, VN) and our relationship with China could be far different and more manageable today.
