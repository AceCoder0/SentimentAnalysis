Insightful and informative. In the news, you may read about the excesses and riches of upper level Party members. In a politics class, you may see some ancient slides about the dual party structure. But this book provides a detailed look that you won't get anywhere else. The author spent years trying to get to people involved with the party from Heilongjiang in the north to Guangdong in the south, interviewing the most elusive current and former party members, and the effort shows. I've learned more about how China actually works in this book than from any other single source.
