Pervasive moral and ethical corruption As I was growing up, I had complete faith in our leaders; however, over the past several decades I learned that trust unfortunately  should not be completly placed  in the government, business,  educational system and more. That does not mean all of our leaders are corrupt, but what has been been shown accurately in this book more people need to be held accountable. This includes currently governmental, business and all those identified in chapter headings. Peter S does us great service in this exposure. It used to be the news media that exposed this type of moral corruption, but they are lacking. Of course, this corruption is not partisan, but in  situations where a person or their family wheels power.
