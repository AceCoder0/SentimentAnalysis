illuminating I realized that I didn’t know as much about China’s as I would like especially with what’s going on in the world today. You need to understand, or try to understand, another culture. Although this book only goes back to the 1800s, there’s enough earlier history woven in that you learn a lot. It is truly a story of two worlds colliding. The ancient Chinese dynasty and the modern world of the barbarians from Europe. Nothing good can come out of two cultures where each views the other as inferior. Unfortunately not much has changed.
