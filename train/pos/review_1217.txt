Excellent Book Outstanding book on the history of the China/US relationship. Very well written and informative. I was a little disappointed that Bradley seemed a bit biased and overly "generous" with his characterization of Mao. In my opinion he elected to ignore some of Mao's negative qualities in support of his thesis. That said, I definitely recommend the book and I'm very glad I read it. I do think anyone reading this book should be sure to read up on Mao and his evolution and policies as well and form their own opinion.
