A  must read. The leit-motif of this book is the ‘red-phone’ on the desks of senior executives in Chinese companies. The idea is that the communist party maintains control of major ‘private’ coporations.  He shows that the three main telecommunications companies, in theory in competition, swopped chief executives at the behest of the party.  McGregor gives us a tour of various parts of Chinese society – industry, the army, the civil service, among others.  He notes the significant part that corruption plays in the party, and the fact that the party;s insistence that there is no other power structure can exist in China, means that the corruption, which is associated with power, cannot be effectively eliminated.  In fact, the waves of investigations of corruption have been used by powerful factions within the party to root out their rivals.My reaction to the book was that a lot of what Is being described is Economic Nationalism – take an example of France – where the government directs a lot of what industrial leaders do, and industrial leaders cycle in and out of government departments.  As I finished the book, it seemed to me that the lack of effective, independent power structures within the society and the regularity and possibility of changing the party in government is what distinguishes Chinese society from Western ones.  A fairly obvious point, but reinforced, in detail, by this excellent book
