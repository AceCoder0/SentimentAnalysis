Easy to ready history that deals with the media bias both leading up to Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor and carried into US relations with both the ROC and PRC and into the Vietnam War.  The author could have been more evenhanded in his reporting of facts, which, at times, seem cherry picked to support his thesis that the US was a willing dupe in entering WW II.  Strongest material is that developed about the role of the China lobby and the influence on the American publics thinking between WW I and WW II, then culminating in the fallout during the McCarthy period.
