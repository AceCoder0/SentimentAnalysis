Required reading! This is a very readable, fascinating book that puts together what a lot of people who pay any attention to China already know - yet perhaps fail to "appreciate".  The central premise is that the CCP works very hard, and largely successfully, to stay behind the scenes, and to run the country through nominal governmental, judicial and legislative entities that are for all practical purposes "front" organizations with no independent power.  It makes one appreciate how the rule of law really is the underlying basis for all liberty.  The next time I'm confronted with a bureaucratic rule being blindly enforced by an unsympathetic bureaucrat... I will try to appreciate how much better that is than having to deal with party officials with almost unlimited power to decide whether to be helpful or obstructive based on their own discretion.The book itself is very readable.  There are a couple of places where the writing is a bit repetitive -- chapter introductions are like "executive summaries" of each chapter.  My Kindle edition had a small number of typographical errors that did not interfere with the book's overall readability.If you do business with China, or are interested in China, or have views on how the west interacts politically with China, you really ought to read this book to help inform your understanding of the fascinating country and state that is modern China.
