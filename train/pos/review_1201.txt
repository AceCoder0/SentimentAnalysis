The Fog Lifts - So that's how the China Lobby Grifted America As a Chinese-American whose mother's family were Nationalists and avowedly anti-Communists, and yet whose father thought the Communist reunification of China and expulsion of foreign powers was the greatest thing since the multi-functional electric rice cooker, I have wondered long how it was possible for America to recognize a tiny little island as official China while disregarding a huge continental landmass of hundreds of millions for decades.The China Mirage uncovers the mystery - our exceptionalist mentality and the Chiang and Soong family's long grift which convinced Henry Luce and the DC Establishment that Chinese were just yearning to be capitalists and Christians, that Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and Madame Chiang would lead the Chinese masses to this Promised land...if only, if only, those inconvenient Communists could be eradicated. Ideological suckers we were, but in Luce's dominating vision of the first American century (and his sincere "love" for the Chinese people), how could we fail but to have played ourselves?
