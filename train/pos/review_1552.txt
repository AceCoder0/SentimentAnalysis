The Chinese Communist Party Can be Confusing to Understand ... Until you Read this Book For many foreigners, China's day to day decisions can be very confusing because there often isn't a clearly stated principle of why many of these decisions happen.  This book shows that the Communist Party in China is really very guarded about having any publicity over its actions.  The Chinese Communist Party does not have any markings noting the building where it is located. It does not have a web site, nor a social media presence, nor does it give a full list of all of its members.  The Party likes to be inside any large organization, private or public, to ensure that nothing happens  randomly that is outside of its control.  This is why there is actually a Communist Party group inside of large corporations, even western ones!, inside China.  Think of your large Western brand in China: many of these companies have pro-Communist Party propaganda in some fashion or another inside the company, and the company must pay for it.  The public image of government in China is overseen by the actual party.  Think of the judiciary.  They don't have any actual power.  The courts are not independent.  They literally just take on a role but the real power is in the hands of the Communist Party, which decides what should transpire.  Another issue is that the Chinese Communist Party is authoritarian, but it is not following the traditional "communist" vision of all the state owning all property.  Rather, the Communist Party in China is literally whatever the Communist Party wants it to mean.  If there is an advantage by taking on a particular policy, even if it contradicts the main tenets of communism, it doesn't matter, because communism means whatever the Communist Party wants it to mean.  That is why it will be a bit harder for the Communist Party to fail in China than it did in Russia.  It is mainly because it is a bit less doctrinaire and ideological than the Soviets were.
