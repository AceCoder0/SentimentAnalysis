You Better Think Outside The Box Nothing to dislike. It has ALL the facts foot noted and nicely organized.  If you are a diehard D or R "party person" you will hate this book when it exposes the level of corruption in Washington DC. on BOTH sides of the isle from the Oval Office to Congress. It angers and disgust me at the same time. As my parents taught me years ago when "you follow the money trail, it will tell you all you need to know."
