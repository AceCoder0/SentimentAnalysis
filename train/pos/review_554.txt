Well Written and Researched - but FRUSTRATING Peter provides no real solutions to the problem of powerful individuals using the US to gain money and influence in China.  Most of our recent presidents were cited as making money from their China relationship, with the exception of Donald Trump.  My frustration  with this book is that it seems to continue with noone taking action to correct the problem.  It also increases my lack of confidence in our government and in high level tech CEOs.
