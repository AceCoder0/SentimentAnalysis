Another great read from Mr. Rutherford I now have read all of this author’s books, and I have enjoyed each one greatly.With this book, he has made a period in China’s history that I knew little about become interesting and fascinating to me. Like all of his other stories, it was full of believable characters that had me wanting to know what was going to happen to them next, such as who’s paths would cross with who’s, where they would turn up, and when, during the span of years this book covers.The place descriptions had me picturing amazingly detailed scenes. The best way to really learn about history, in my opinion, is to read a totally immersive book like this one, the people and places affected are made real. I hope there will be yet another great book by this author!
