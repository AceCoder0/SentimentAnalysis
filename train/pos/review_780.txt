Excellent Book to Learn about the Real China I decided to pick up this book to learn about China, now one of the most important countries.  This book focuses on TRUST - “Can We Trust China?”  This reading reminded me of a very relevant story I heard from a Vietnamese friend some time ago.  He said his Chinese father never needed a paper contract in conducting his business for decades in Vietnam.  His trusted customers can pick up products and needed only pay his father after they have sold the products.  This was done verbally without any paper contract.  A new customer would be given a chance to start small and prove his/her trustworthy in time.  If anyone cheats, the words of mouth would spread quickly in the trusting community; and it would be very difficult for this bad person to rejoin this Chinese business community again.  My friend said he never heard any one cheated and his father never had a lawyer. The “trust” stories in the book are different but it tells the same “trust” I learned from this friend.  It is very interesting to see someone elaborating this topic in a book in great depth.  It is written in away enjoyable to read.  Despite I have heard a similar story before, I still learn a lot more from this book.  This is absolutely a great book anyone can learn in order to be successful with China or Chinese.
