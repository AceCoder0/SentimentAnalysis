We've been betrayed. My, Uncle worked at IBM out of Fishkill NY where he worked on development of some of the legendary 'Super Computers' in the 60's and, 70's. The, Chinese in the 70's were sending PR Emissaries to the Tech, Energy and other Industries back then. He, he made a very disturbing statement to me. After one of their 'Friendship' Tours to his plant he, said to me 'These, people are going to cut our throats and take over the World. I, don't trust them one bit. This, is more than just business'.  I, understand now that the 'Greatest Generation' had more 'Skin (and Blood) in the game' than anyone else. This, was their America. They, wouldn't put it that way but they, paid for it and for our safety and prosperity.  California tauts itself for its schools and Silicon Valley. Let me tell you, California doesn't grow its own brains. They, import them. We, better start 'Waking Up' and end the coma of 'WOKING UP'. Do not be afraid of speaking your mind.
