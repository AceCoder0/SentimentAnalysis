Is China past ...China future? ... hard to say from this book. Book is a nice overview of China policy from the early 1900s till today. The focus of the book is how US policy toward China is influenced by our religious Judeo Christian ethic. Bradley spends considerable time in the book  describing  the how our China policy  was influenced by our desire  to Christianize  the heathen.  Pearl Buck  and Luce from Time magazine, had a profound effect on the way the Chinese were portrayed in the thirties to the fifties. I was completely unaware of the so-called China lobby that had such a strong influence in Washington. I think Bradley may have taken a bit too long on the role that FDR played in shaping China policy. I felt that the book got a bit stuck in the World War 2 era. We didn't understand the Chinese then... spent little time in the country... and had few diplomats that I actually knew the real China. AN area in which I felt the book was lacking, was was that there were few policy prescriptions for dealing with modern China. I didn't come away from the book feeling I had any idea of how we should approach the modern behemoth that China has become today. I'm not sure how our past China policy should influence the direction of our current political discourse.
