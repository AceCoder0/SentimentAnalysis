For Bradley,Chairman Mao Zedong is a saint. in comparison to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek Bradley as always has written a good popular history of American-Chinese relationships. He is not afraid to show us our Americans weaknesses and blindness to evil!We meet the American Brahman, the supposed best families of America in the China opium trade, no different than the Colombian Narco Barons.  American missionaries misrepresenting the reality of China, skewing  American political perceptions resulting in tragic results. The love relationship between the missionaries, Time magazine and the gangster Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek is astonishing!.A tremendous obliviousness to Chairman Mao Zedong's monstrosities and 80 million Chinese murdered by Mao do not get a mention. In retrospect for Bradley, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman Mao Zedong is a saint.To get a balanced portrait of this era I suggest as a supplement to Bradley's "The China Mirage",  to read the biography of Mao Zedong, by Jung Chang & Jon Halliady, "The Unknown Story, Mao".
