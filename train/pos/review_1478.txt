This book was eye opening for me A very interesting and descriptive book about China. Things have changed in China but the media uses the same words such as "communists" and "dictators" as they did decades ago. The book describes the relaxation of state control over individuals and what it takes now to have the state crack down on an individual. The China media and the US media take the same approach to many news stories that are not politically correct. They let them die rather than censor them.  After reading the book I would say that China is a democracy where only 10% of the people can vote and where the leaders have to work their way up as managers in different provinces for 30 years before they can hope to make it to top party positions.  Then they share power and have to step down after two terms.  The MSM calls China a 'dictatorship' but can't name the 'dictator.'
