More action and treachery than history I always find reason to enjoy Rutherfurd's books. While 'China' kept my attention, I didn't learn much about Chinese history that I didn't already know, as the battles and treacherous characters dominated the book. Several of the key individuals were beyond believable; more suited to science fiction than a historical novel. I still gave 'China' four stars as I finished the book in about a week, engaged nicely until the last several disapointing chapters  and weak ending. I will get into Rutherfurd's 'London' next.
