This one should piss you off. This one should piss you off; which is more or less exactly why you need to read it.Not dunking on the Chinese people.It’s the CCP’s relentless encroachment into every aspect of our culture and the complicity of American politicians from both parties that will make you want to puke.Well researched. Arguably the most meticulously cited book I have ever picked up.Schweizer has his facts straight in a body of work that is unassailable.Required reading my friends.
