Bill Gates and Joe Biden are only two of the many American elites getting rich helping China win. Bill Gates, Joe Biden, and many more are outed by Peter Schweizer in his book, Red-Handed, How American Elites Get Rich Helping China Win.  With hard-hitting information like the following, the book is a must-read for anyone who wants to take back our country:How Google, Microsoft, and other Big Tech companies knowingly help the Chinese military compete with us. (One wonders why they are not charged with treason.)How the Biden family bagged some $31 million from individuals with direct ties to the highest levels of Chinese intelligence—and Joe Biden personally benefitted while softening his position on China.And that’s just a small sample of the “profiles in corruption” detailed in this riveting book.  I haven’t finished it yet, but am anxious to see if the author has action suggestions for the reader.
