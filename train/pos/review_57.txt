Very engaging, classic Rutherfurd style. Fascinating glimpse into an important time in China and the people, politics, customs and practices of that and earlier times. The narrative engages from the outset and just doesn't let go. You won't want to put it down. As in his other books set in England and elsewhere, Rutherfurd's rich imagination is woven upon an impressive loom of historical and cultural fact. Yes. I liked this book very much.
