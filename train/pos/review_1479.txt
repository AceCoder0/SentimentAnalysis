The reality underneath the facade This book will change your understanding of China.  McGregor's main theme is that China is coming to look more and more like Western societies on the surface, with similar market and other institutions--but as he shows repeatedly, under the surface the country still runs on Soviet hardware.  He tells his story with panache.Most fascinating and original is how he describes the continuing control the party still has over the commanding heights of the economy, particularly over publicly traded companies.  The book is brimming with fascinating anecdotes to back up its claims.  I particularly enjoyed the story of how the Party decided to simply switch the management teams of two publicly traded companies that were competing against each other in the same industry, practically overnight; it's as if you awoke one morning to find that the top management of Ford and GM had simply switched places with each other.  Dorothy, this isn't Kansas.The highest praise for a book on current affairs is that it will change the way you think, and what you understand when you read the newspaper.  This book accomplishes both.I'm baffled as to how anyone could give it fewer than five stars.  Yes, it doesn't tell a seemless story, but that's not the nature of the material.  A fun and penetrating read.
