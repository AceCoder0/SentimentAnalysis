Very Interesting Book This is a really interesting book. The title says it all. America has been messing around in Asia for a century and a half and we still don't get it.The author has some sort of vendetta against the Roosevelt cousins. He really wants to point out that they had no idea what they were doing and how those actions caused a lot of death and destruction. I wish at the beginning of the book he would just come out and say I don't like them and here is why. This book has a similar feel to "The Imperial Cruise" where the author again goes on a tirade against TR.There also seems to be an issue with Mao in this book. Anything evil or bad that he may have done is sort of skipped over. The author seems to go out of his way to show that Mao wanted to be our friend but we weren't interested. He left out the part about Mao doing a lot of killing of his own people to achieve power. Chiang on the other hand gets the rough treatment from Mr Bradley. He's in cahoots with the FDR so he doesn't get a pass on anything. Any bad quote from anyone is included. I'm not passing judgement. Just an observation.This is not the story you read in your high school textbooks. It's one that everyone should read. It's not flattering to the Roosevelt cousins.
