Great Insight into American History While Mr. Bradley is somewhat anti-American I love his books and hope he continues to write the truth about our history.  He brings out the truth and sheds a light on our relationship with China and how the Chinese took advantage of our stupid politicians while our businessmen took advantage of them with drugs.This book gives you great insights into Chinese / American relationships and you will soon figure out that the Chinese continue to scam our country and government because we / they know little about the true history of the relationship and all we seem to care about is cheap products!!!
