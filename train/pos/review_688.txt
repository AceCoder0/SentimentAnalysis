This author never disappoints! If you happen to see any review less than 5 stars or with any negative remarks, please be warned that they will be done from the perspective of those desperate to change the narrative and will obviously be political given this author researches quite thoroughly and accurately and is sharing crucial information that every single American absolutely needs to know.If more people read the works of Peter Schweizer, then we would not currently be in the disastrous political situation we are in now as a nation. The more aware we become of what this author is trying to convey, the better chance we have of avoiding more of such unconscionable actions by those in whom many place their trust-but shouldn't.I decided to gobble up this fascinating book via Audible version, which is tough considering my usual habit of highlighting much of what Peter Schweizer writes to revisit later, but it's done in a pleasant voice and easy to follow. I might still read the regular version but in the meantime wanted to share the strong recommendation to pick up a copy of Red Handed today. You will not be disappointed and let's hope that those who really need to know how we got here and where we are sadly heading will do the same.
