Typical Rutherford novel with narrower time-frame According to the product description "The story begins in 1839, at the dawn of the First Opium War, and follows Chinese history through Mao's Cultural Revolution and up to the present day".I was therefore surprised when the book came to a sudden halt after the briefest of references to the dissolution of the empire following the 1911 revolution and the rise of regional warlords.The story and writing is generally what you might expect of Rutherford, but captured far less of the subject than most of his books. I am mystified as to why the product description is so misleading. It is the same on every online bookseller and library I have checked.
