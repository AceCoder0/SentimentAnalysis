Want to get lost in an extraordinary book?? I’m old and have come late to Mr. Rutherford.It is certainly true that Rutherford writes “big” books: 700-900 hundred pages. It is also true that the reader cannot put him down. He does due diligence when it comes to historical background, provides characters of whom one does not wish to let go and makes the reader wish his big book was twice as long. I’ve now ordered every novel he’s published.
