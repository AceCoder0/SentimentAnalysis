Lest the truth be known about China A 'must read' for those interested in the real story before WWII  in China and the US.  Facts unknown or never released come to light that shed an entirely different view of Chaing Kai Shek's China and how the US got taken to the cleaners.  The false narrative Americans believed and the missed opportunities we ignored because of paranoia about Communism.  We talk about other country's teaching of history missing sensitive issues.  Here's a book that should be part of American history.  Previously, only glimpses and partial insight gave hints of mistakes and misguided directions we took.  Bradley points out 'what might have been' had our leaders been more astute about China, her history her politics, and her leaders.  Are we again, headed along the same path?  Are war and aggression embedded in our DNA?  We seem to go from one extreme to another and can't seem to take the middle path.
