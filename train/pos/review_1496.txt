Welcome to the Party I spent the last four years living in China, serving as the president of a Chinese bank.  That role took me to 44 cities all across China, where I met hundreds of government officials and Party members. I worked daily with the General Secretary of the bank's Party Committee.  During my time in China I read every major book by any foreigner who had lived and worked in China.  Richard's book, The Party, is the most insightful book I have encountered. If you wish to understand how China is run today and you only have time to read one book, then read this one.
