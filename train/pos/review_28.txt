A Visit to the Celestial Kingdom We know the China of today, but until recently, China was closed to the world. Edward Rutherford takes us to the China of the 19th century. The end of the Manchu Dynasty is near and the world of the Mandarins and Confucianism  is fading. China is plagued by Western countries wanting to trade with this secretive and closed country.Author Rutherford is one of my favorite authors because he uses regular people to bring the accurate history he presents to life. His sagas are long, which is wonderful, and his stories are beautifully told. The Opium War, Taiping Rebellion, and Boxer Rebellion allow us to get to know a Mandarin, a Chinese pirate, a beautiful peasant and her family, a British missionary family, a Manchu soldier, a British Opium trader, and best of all the witty and clever “palace person”, a eunuch named Lacquer Nail.Filled with adventure, romance, exciting battles and interesting diplomacy, this book, a “you are there” presentation of history, is a page-turner.
