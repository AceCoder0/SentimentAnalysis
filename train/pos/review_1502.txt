full of big events in past 10 years -- excellent observation I bought and read the book with curiosity, however i must say it's one of best reading about China and its economic development and its economic and political policy in real examples. The author is an exceptional observer and had shrew view and great access to some insiders.The book is a must-read for anyone who is interested in knowing China and in doing business in China.
