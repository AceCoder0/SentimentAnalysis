Important and informative book which should be read by all. An excellent and informative read. China is paying off the political class of this country and they are perfectly content to take money for their personal enrichment. Peter doesn't spare the "right wing" Republicans either. Both parties are guilty of treason as far as I'm concerned. The love of money is destroying the U.S. and polititians are more than willing to sell out America for financial gain. How do our Representatives and Senators become so rich? This book gives a lot of information that makes it clear. I hope American citizens read this book and rise up before it's too late.
