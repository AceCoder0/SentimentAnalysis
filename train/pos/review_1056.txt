A Must Read for all interested in U S policies in Asia and China in particular. I learned so much about the Roosevelt family history that I was unable to get from watching Ken Burn's documentary. For example how would anyone know their grand father became immensely wealthy from opium trade forced on China at the turn of the century!! Also how will the general even educated public ever know that MAO at the beginning of his "revolution" i.e. uplifting the millions of down trodden peasants at the expense of their oppressive "landlords/owners", reached out to American government for help several times?!  I also learned that General Stilwell was not well received in the high echelon of U S. military and the state department because at the beginning of WWII he went to China to observe. What he saw was Mao's spirited peasants who wanted to expel the Japanese whereas General Chang's conscripted armies, ill armed and ill fed despite millions of our govt's aid fled at the first sight of a Japanese soldier. This book is a must read for all who are interested in current US foreign policies especially Asia.
