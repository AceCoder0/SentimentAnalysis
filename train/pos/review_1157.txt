An excellent and thought-provoking book by Dr Rush Doshi This is the latest in series of excellent books (see also Jonathan Ward, Peter Martin, and Michael Pillsbury) about China’s rise and long-term strategy to achieve its dream of rejuvenation by 2049.  Dr Doshi knows his subject and takes the reader through China’s evolving strategy since 1972.  The author skillfully weaves the dialogue, drawing on multiple Chinese sources.  He sees the strategy as less about Xi per se, and more about the CCP.  But Xi has been a clear and forceful accelerant with respect to China’s recent aggressive military, diplomatic, and intelligence initiatives.  A must-read book, congratulations to Dr Doshi.  5 stars!
