Excellent An excellent book for those who would like to better understand the current world and the precarious balance of power between China and America. The author gives great insights into Xi Jinping's vision of China's development and goals and possible scenarios of shifts in geopolitics in the 2020s. Whatever happens, we'll be living dangerously in the decade to come.
