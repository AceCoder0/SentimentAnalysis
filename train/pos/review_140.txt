It was not what I expected I have read just about all the Rutherfurd books.  I love historical fiction.  I could not get into this book, however.  It was just not the "China" I expected.  What did I expect?  I don't really know. Was hoping to be enlightened.  It definitely was not this.  However, I still think Rutherfurd is a great writer.
