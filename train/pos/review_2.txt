Yet Another Masterpiece Professor Dikötter is far and away among the world's leading experts on China. Daring to venture into restricted archives and subject matter with which few other scholars grapple, Dikötter upholds the pursuit of truth in the classical tradition.China After Mao clearly and eloquently sets the historical narrative straight, refuting and discrediting the manifold failings of the conventional narrative peddled by so many lesser "experts" and insiders over the past 40 years. The work details time and again the internal dysfunction, cynicism, and poor judgement at the heart of the PRC's political economy, belying the polished propaganda narrative proclaiming a great economic miracle delivered by an enlightened leadership which never was.In light of the brewing crisis within China and between the PRC and the West, this book could not be more timely, and is sure to be cited in future analyses and histories, proof that sober thinking at least existed in certain corners of the western mind in the early 21st century.
