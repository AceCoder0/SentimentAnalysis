USA did not take the moral high ground in Asia by committing sins such as greed and deceit I hope the author is credible on his sources of information.  This book strongly focused on the hidden factors that drive the wealth gap, and how Harvard and other elite schools ignore forensics and, similar to the 1493/4 Tordesillas Treaty where Spain and Portugal claimed the world, USA thought Christianity will conquer China by weaponizing and using Japan as a tool.  Japan willingly became a puppet initially because it saw the devastating impact of opium wars on China, and then decided to leverage USA to pursue Asia such as the takeover of Korea.  Japan was submissive to USA but wanted to be supreme in Asia.  That's the way it is today, as evidenced by Japan's nomination of a eugenicist narcissist for the Nobel Peace Prize.
