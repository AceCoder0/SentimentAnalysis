An Epic of Dickensian Proportions A fascinating book with the range of characters and events worthy of Dickens.Both readable and informative there are the occasional longeurs, the early life of Lacquer Nail is somewhat tedious, for example, but the central character, Trade,r who ties the story together develops credibly with age.A good read.
