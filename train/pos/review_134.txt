Very Typical Rutherfurd I’ve read every book written by Edward Rutherfurd, and have found them all to be very readable and educational.  He writes very much in the same style and genre as James Michener, though perhaps just a slight cut below Michener’s best work.This book differs slightly from that of both Michener and Rutherfurd’s previous works, in that it covers a relatively short time frame of 60 years.  It commences with the years immediately preceding the Opium War of the 1840s, focusing on Macau, Canton and the founding of Hong Kong, then progresses through the Taiping and Boxer Rebellions into the early years of the 20th century.As in his previous works, Rutherfurd tells the story of China during the period by looking at the lives of several of the actors, including a British trader, a Chinese peasant woman, a Chinese pirate, a sub-prefect and an imperial court eunuch.  The author alternates story arcs well through the period in question.While the time frame in this case is compressed when compared to his previous work, earlier years of Chinese history are touched upon within many of the story arcs.  If you’ve read Rutherfurd before, you know what to expect and wont be disappointed.  If you’ve read and enjoyed Michener, you’ll find Rutherfurd a worthy successor.
