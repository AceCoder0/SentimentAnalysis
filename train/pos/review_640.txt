Please read this book! Peter Schweitzer does his research and sources everything thoroughly. Having read his previous book “Profiles in Corruption”, I couldn’t wait to read this book. The corruption goes all around, Democrats, Republicans, Wall Street, Hollywood, ad infinitum. It’s much worse than I actually thought and it’s very concerning.Really, it’s all about money. The Chinese have it and folks here in the United States and globally want the money. Forget integrity, forget what’s good for those around you. The Chinese money is seductive to the point that people just lose who they are. This book just blew my socks off to see how the Chinese have infiltrated every way possible into what was once a country that was not dependent in any way shape or form on the Chinese.It’s just a dirty little secret of what happens especially with government officials when they leave office how they immediately  cozy up to the Chinese. Or, not so secret, just look at Hollywood or Disney for example and their double standard when it comes to doing business with China. It’s all in this book and it will shock you and worry you. As it should! He won’t be able to put this book down.
