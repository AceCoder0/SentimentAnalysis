The Chinese Church Not A Western Front. Heard author speak of his book on CSPAN2. The history of Christianity in China is clearly checkered with Western Imperialism. However, the author also clearly knows little about the indigenous Christian Church in China which has grown exponentially in the absence of Western missionaries. Stick to what you know. Avoid generalization. You'd think the author, in light of Western ignorance about China and the disastrous consequences thereof, would avoid stumbling into the same ignorance trap. His points are well taken in general but he has some major blind spots in his own analogy of the China truck on the human highway.
