Good but narrowly focused The book is pretty narrowly focused on specific policy suggestions that would affect either childhood development or health, or the pre-university education system. It's not bad, but just don't expect a wider examination of rural-urban labor issues.I'm surprised the authors don't give more time to what the situation is like now for rural people that didn't receive that investment in human capital. For example most cities in China are filled with a lot of young men (but increasingly older men and some women) who deliver food for very low wages as gig workers for large startups. They're a ubiquitous sight across China and having a lot of young rural men rushing around delivery food orders for very low wages speaks to labor market issues, lack of investment in human capital, and a growing urban-rural divide. But it's not really mentioned in the book.My other criticism is that the book often compares countries that got trapped in middle income (Mexico) and countries that got out (Ireland, South Korea). But there isn't much serious comparison or analysis here. The example often seem breezily cited as evidence of the authors claims about China.
