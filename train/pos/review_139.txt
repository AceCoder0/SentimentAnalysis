Edward Rutherfurd is brilliant! When I saw that this book, CHINA, by Edward Rutherfurd, was available on Netgalley, I was so excited. He is one of my top 5 authors! And this book did not disappoint! He has written about the most wonderfully developed characters, Trader, Laquer Nail, Empress Dowager Cixi! in a novel that includes foot binding!, The Opium Wars, The Taiping Rebellion, The Boxer Rebellion, the Forbidden City and so much more of Chinese history, all of it with the beautiful landscape of the country of China in the background. There is so much in this novel. I loved reading about Mei-Ling, Shi-Rong and Nio and Guanji...that's all I'll say about them since there are no spoilers here.  This is truly a remarkable book by Mr. Rutherfurd! and anyone who loves history will adore this book.  He has done extensive research into the history of China and its dynasties.  It's all there!Thank you to Netgalley and Doubleday Publishers for the galley of this amazing book!
