On the Intricacies of the Communist Party of China This 2010 book details the role the Communist Party of China plays in guiding the ship of state, as well as how the regions interact with the center, different factions within the system, and the role the party plays in shaping foreign, defense, and domestic policy. Even though the book is more than a decade old at this point, given that the system being described is almost a hundred years old and draws on far older ideas of relationships within China, there is no reason to believe the system has changed much. The author even describes what is almost assuredly the model the current Chinese leader, Xi Jinping used in establishing his first-among-equals role in China today. This book proved excellent background to anyone interested in power dynamics in China and the likely trajectory of the country while the CCP remains at the center of the power structure.
