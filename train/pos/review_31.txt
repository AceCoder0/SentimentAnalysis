China pivots into a relevant nation. This book differs from his others that I enjoyed--Sarum, London, Ruska etc... in that it focuses not on centuries of history but on a few decades that reflected upon past centuries and impacted future centuries.  Character development is not critical in historical fiction and in this book the characters are not particularly interesting--they serve to characterize politics and history, not to enhance your understanding of human nature.  However, the historical insight makes this book a must read--and, it's validity is enhanced by the author's carefully balanced East/West perspective--the western characters, policies, and actions are ambiguous at best and at times indefensible.  For me, this was a welcome balance.  This is not a lecture, it is not about Western or Eastern heroes--it IS an extremely intelligent insight into the second most pivotal era in China's long history.  A must read for anyone seeking a balanced perspective on China's pre-communism history.
