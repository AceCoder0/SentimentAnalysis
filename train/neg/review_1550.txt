An overrated book that taks more about the relationship between the Party and Capitalism Read my whole critic here: [...]The book has been praised and well received by critics and audiences, who have placed it almost at the height of "the definitive book about how the Party runs the country". Maybe my expectations were too high, but the truth is that the book does not achieve such an ambitious goal. Richard McGregor certainly makes an interesting account of general aspects of the party organization and its power, but you always have the feeling that he could have dug further, that the real protagonists, the decision makers, are still in the shade. The author himself playes a lot with the idea of the Party as an invisible force, which ultimately can leave the reader the impression that "yes, is very difficult to know how the party works, and you weren't able to find out neither after all".I don't know if the title (The Party, The Secret World of China's Communist Rulers) was chosen by McGregor or by the publishing house, but the truth is that it seems much more a marketing technique than a description of its content. Actually, there are no big leaders talking in the book, it doesn't explain how the laws are passed in the country, it doesn't speak about the Communist Youth (an important Party organization that seems to be growing in influence) and there is a lack of many other key issues (it would have been interesting to talk about the politicians in the government that are not party members, like Chen Zhu).The book, however, is a very interesting description of the relationship between the Party and business. Here you can see some of the most important CEO of the country, the books examines who pulls the strings within each company and the symbiosis that's going on between the Party and entrepreneurs. The description of the corruption case of Chen Liangyu, the former party secretary of Shanghai, is a fascinating glimpse of the abuses of power in contemporary China and the internal disputes within the government. Special mention also for the case of milk contaminated with melamine after the Beijing Olympics, explained from the point of view of the company, the media and the government in a way that makes you see how the system failures can be lethal for its citizens.As a former Financial Times reporter, McGregor has used all his contacts he has developed over last  years in China, and the result is an interesting book where the economy is the protagonist. Two of the eight chapters are clearly about this ("China Inc.: The Party and Business" and "Deng Perfects Socialism: the Party and Capitalism"), but others chapters like the one about corruption, the personnel selection or "the Party and the Regions") tend to end up inevitably into the economic field. In this sense, the book can be fascinating for those (and there are many) who see China as an economic opportunity, are doing business in the country or are interested in the business world
