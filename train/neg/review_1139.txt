The correct title for this book should be American's vision on China's grand strategy If you want to understand what is China's grand strategy, if any, from this book, you will probably be disappointed. The shortcomings of this book is the lacking of real data but relying on author's understanding of Chinese documents to deduce China's grand strategy. No doubt, China has its only policy in dealing with US but if the author knows the word "propaganda", then he should not put too much focus on some word counts (like the one in Figure 11.1 in the book).Besides, discussing "grand strategy" should go with discussing economic power of a country. If the author could research China GDP from 1970 to 2020, he would understand why China did not directly make a head to head race instead of "blunting" US in 80s to 90s. The truth is China did not have enough economic strength to deal with US or any other western powers in those eras. This is the major flaw of this book and all other arguments failed accordingly.Another failed argument of this book is related to why China delaying carriers development in 90s. To make it clear, the argument of this book does not base on technology or economic sense. The author just based on his own subjective speculations. China is never a strong ship building country in 80s even until today. The strongest players in this field in Asia is South Korea and Japan. And China has no technology lead in making fighter jets or steam catapult. To conclude, it is not China did not make carrier but it just simply cannot make it.There are numerous examples in this book showing the author's superficial knowledge on China. The only pros of this book is that it shows how incompetent of US understands China. If US relies on such low level think tank to develop its strategy to deal with China, US is doomed to failed in Sino-US relationship.I got this book by 9.99, but I think this book just worth 0.99.
