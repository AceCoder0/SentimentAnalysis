A Good Revelation of History Lesson I read with interest The China Mirage and the early history between US and China, particularly in having lived in pre WWII China. In the latter part of the book where Dean Acheson is blamed for the cause of japan's war with US, I believe that this is more opinionated on the part of the author than based on facts. In other parts of the book where the author exposes the Joe McCarthy Red Herring era, the Communist threat and the Domino theory, having been exposed to these matters first hand as they occurred, the author makes points which are more personal than objective in my opinion
