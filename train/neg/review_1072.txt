Biased and Incomplete Save your money. This book mostly repeats the Chinese Communist version of the war. To believe this book, the Japanese were always in the wrong and the Chinese were always in the right. You'd never know from reading this book that the Chinese Nationalists actually killed more people than did the Japanese, or that it was the Chinese who first moved large numbers of troops into the area of Shanghai (even though Japan had just made a generous peace offer), or that it was the Chinese who launched the first large-scale attack in Shanghai.If you're looking for books that provide a much more balanced analysis of the Sino-Japanese War, I suggest reading Peter Harmsen's book Storm Clouds over the Pacific, 1931â€“1941 and Dick Wilson's book When Tigers Fight.
