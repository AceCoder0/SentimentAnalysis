Tedious, tedious, tedious I waited impatiently for China to come out, having read all of Rutherford’s books and thoroughly enjoying them. I reread several. The longer the better, the books were riveting.Not so China. I had to keep talking myself into going back and picking China up. Halfway through, I gave up. Chapters dragged on, repetition opium issue was boring. Most of all, I expected a panoramic view of China since that was the title, not a novel from the 1800s on.  I’ll never know if the book got better because I’m still asleep.
