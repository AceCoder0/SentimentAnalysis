who lost china? truman and his "wise men" This book could have been written in 1955, not 2015.  It's as if the author was asleep for 60 years, and not discovered like almost everyone did what a monster Mao really was, and how the oft repeated "corrupt" Chiang became a wise and reform, though still dictatorial ruler on Taiwan.  A book that is ambivalent as to who should rule post war China is morally bankrupt.  FDR was basically correct to support Chiang, there were really no alternatives (other than the Mao and the communists, or korea-like chaos).  Truman's de-facto neutrality (Chiang or Mao? What difference, at this point, does it make?)  and lack of sustained military support for Chiang during the civil war was the great tragedy and failure of US foreign policy.
