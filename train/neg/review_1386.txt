A very good and detailed account for the long tangled history of America/Asia relationship, however, I think the author is bias Well, as a Taiwanese immigrant, I appreciate Mr. Bradley's work digging through history and give us a detailed account of what happened. However, his interpretation of history is greatly flawed. He chose to ignore the suffering of Communist China's disastrous regime, the corruption of current Chinese government, the oppression the Chinese government is exerting on the people of China. He chose to focus on the benefit of America, how to avoid war even with the price of sacrificing Chinese people's democracy and human rights. I am also very very offended by his comment of 'Taiwan being part of China and will be part of China'. You know, there are more than 23 millions of people living on that island enjoying the democracy and freedom that they fought long and hard with. Mr. Bradley, you might know a lot of historic facts and events, your family may have had some special experience wit conflicts, but it is the rhetoric like yours that helped Nazi in WWII and ISIS in today.
