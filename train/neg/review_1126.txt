Easy read, but no discussions of China's relative weakness and strength, therefore not much value The book is easy to read. And that's all the good things I can say about it.The main point is clear, that China will decline very soon, and therefore it will seize its chance before it's gone.The problem is, when you do strategic analysis, you need to analyze a player's strength and weakness relative to its opponents/competitors.The main reasons behind the authors' "decline predictions" include shrinking population, debts, stagnation in innovation, and geopolitical encirclement. The problem is, how does China do relative to its opponents/competitors.- Demographics: Sure, China's population will shrink very soon, if not already. But that's a problem with Japan, Korea, Taiwan and EU as well. US still has population growth, but its problems are in the population structure (racial mix, illegal immigrants, etc.).- Debt: Well, do people really think the US or Japan are doing a lot better?-  Stagnation in innovation: Again, it's a universal problem. In addition, in technological stagnation, followers like China can actually do better by taking the proven paths, while leaders like the US have no where else to go.- Geopolitical issues: Think about how well the US is doing in the middle east, Africa and Ukraine.  Therefore, the authors' analyses don't contain much value. For China haters, you can get some emotional lift out of it, but that's it, don't expect intellectual gains. In addition, the book is just a lengthy version of authors' article "The End of Chinaâ€™s Rise Beijing Is Running Out of Time to Remake the World" (Foreign Affairs, Oct 2021). The readers interested in the topic can just read that article and save their time and money.
