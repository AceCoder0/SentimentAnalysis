Yes... But It isn't so much what the book says that I object to (although placing B-52s in the WWII era is certainly sloppy research by any standard). It is what the book, with a clear agenda, leaves out. Bradley is quick to point out Chiang's many irrefutable flaws but he seems oblivious to Mao's. Mao was arguably the worst genocidal maniac in the history of the world ( Between 50,000,000 to 70,000,000 murdered), yet Bradley thinks US diplomacy  would have been better served by befriending him rather than Chiang.
