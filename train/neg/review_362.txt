The Old Postwar China Lobby Rears its Tired Head I bought this book. I received this book ... just like Peter Schweitzer's others. It's printed on cheap paper, lazily "perfect" bound, and is good bathroom reading for 2021 before it gathers dust in a couple years at the local Goodwill next to expired 80's era Clancy novels. The book is full of limited hangouts, red-baiting, and pseudo-outrage, but it's really just a propaganda artifact of The Now, just like his easily forgotten Clinton Cash and Secret Empires or whatever. Richard Blum. refreshingly appears in the index, but the Central Intelligence Agency does not - despite the author being the "William J Casey Fellow" at the Hoover Institution (and if you want something 'spooky' - try researching an honest authentic bio of Herbert Hoover). The big failing of this pseudonarrative gussied up as explosive muckraking is that it provides no context: what EXACTLY is going on (overtly and covertly) with the US, China, Banksters, and geopolitics. This goes back to 70's grand strategy and technology transfer, and I'm lost swimming in a bunch of fake pseudo-outraged limited hangouts about nothingburgers like LeBron James. It's not like the author tried to educate the reader about what a "proprietary" is, after all. So, stay happy in the current affairs matrix, but don't expect to learn anything.There isn't even a single blurb on the dust-cover endorsing the book by anybody of importance concerned with matters of consequence.
