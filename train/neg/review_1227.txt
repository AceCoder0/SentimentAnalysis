It's a great book, if you can get it! The rating is for the hard cover version.  The jacket and hard cover binding say "The China Mirage" by James Bradley.  The inside pages are the novel "Pachinko."  I returned for a refund and ordered the Kindle version.  It is a must read for anyone who learned what I would call, "American History Mythology."  Be prepared for busting many myths of our great leaders who had no knowledge of Asia but thought they were experts, making catastrophic errors that lead to the Pacific war, communist China, the Vietnam war, and probably the Korean War.  It is a reminder of similar mistakes that wasted many lives and $trillions in Iraq and Afghanistan, in my view.  This follows James Bradley's "The  Imperial Cruise" which is another excellent revision of history that we need to learn about.
