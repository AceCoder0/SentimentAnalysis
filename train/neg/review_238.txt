Putting American Policymakers in a False Sense of Comfort? Heard about this book from a U.S.-CHINA ECONOMIC AND SECURITY REVIEW COMMISSION hearing. Checked it out at our local library.The book mostly paints a dire outlook of China's economy based upon the inelasticity of labor workforce. The author illustrated, with examples of many countries, how this is a problem especially to mid-income countries. Economics 101 tells us labor inelasticity is a problem in all economies and high-come country like US are not exempt.By the author's own account, China started addressing the problem 20 years ago in 2000 by expanding higher education capacity and making education free and mandatory up to junior-high level. It looks to me the problem would be eradicated in China in 2030-2040.US's economy has been in transition since 1990s too, with manufacturing jobs moving overseas, US has problem with labor being inelastic too. Civilian labor force participation in US has declined 4% since 2000 to pre-pandemic and another 1.5% decline since pandemic (according to US Bureau of Labor Statistic). That's people dropping out of the workforce. US is the only G7 country with declining overall labor participation since 1990s according to OECD data. Where would US be in 2030-2040?
