Not good historical writing My main problem with this book is that itâ€™s author seems to view no issue as being in any way complex. There is simply his opinion and stupid opinions. The writing seems almost unprofessional. His constant references to Henry Stimson as The First Wise Man has the feel of childish name-calling. Finally, knowing what we know today, it's hard to fathom ANYBODY portraying Mao in a positive light. Did it ever occur to this author that Mao did not always mean what he said?
