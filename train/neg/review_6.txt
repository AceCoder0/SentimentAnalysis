Analysis of pre-Xi era of dubious accuracy or present valur Admittedly I did not read this book in its entirety. Once I realized that the author’s analysis of China’s economy ends in 2012, the utility of the book greatly diminished. After all, Xi Jinping had not assumed his present position. Thus, this book covers a well-analyzed period of Chinese economic history and adds little value from its “delay” of a decade.In fact, the author makes many specious arguments such as China’s progress was solely debt fuelled which, of course, fails to make the critical distinction between finance capitalism and industrial capitalism (Michael Hudson); he also, surprisingly, fails to grasp the ongoing high valuation that successive pre-Xi administrations made (qv Deng’s comment on rare earths back in the 80s) have placed on technology; and certainly the implications of Japan’s experience thoroughly eludes him.Sadly, this bulky volume tells us less about today’s current situation than most long forgotten volumes written in 2010.“Those that know, do; those that do not know, teach” — few better examples of this adage are available than this book.
