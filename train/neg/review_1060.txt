Chiang Kai-Shek was the best choice. Bradley has some love affair with Mao Misses a few basic points. 1)- You have to pick between one of the two sides in a civil war.Your man may not be a saint. Chiang Kai-Shek was the best choice. Bradley has some love affair with Mao.He'd do well to ask the 30 million Chinese beaten,starved ,or worked to death by Mao during the Great Leap Forward.He might also look at the victims of the Cultural Revolution.Mao was one of the twentieth century"s most brutal dictators,well ahead of Hitler. Ask the people of North Korea,East Germany,and Red China what they thought of the communism of the 1950's,1960's,1970's.Compare them to South Korea,West Germany and Taiwan.Where would you go for freedom and prosperity ? 2)-Bradley seems to have no problems with Japanese aggression in the pre Pearl Harbor days. He'd keep sending the oil to Japan in spite of actions like the Rape of Nanking.Bradley aligns himself with some of history's worse villains. War is indeed an ugly thing but sometimes you have to stand for something.
