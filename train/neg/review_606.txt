Biased Undoing fluence of the Chinese government on our politicians is certainly that something should be explored. Unfortunately, this book is simply right wing propaganda that completely ignores that it was the republican party that originally started our pro China policy. Remember Richard Nixon and the open door policy to China? Well this book wants you to forget it along with most of history. Not worth the trouble to read.
