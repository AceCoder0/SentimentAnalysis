A lengthy disposition, but not wide or deep Three basic propositions are made in the course of this book. 1) millions of rural citizens are being left behind in China's economic development 2) the education of rural citizens is not a priority for China's leaders 3) the prescription of multi-vitamins would transform the health and intellect of the rural population.  Examples of these three propositions are made and repeated over and over in this over-long book.It is true that the pursuance of globalism has resulted in the off-shoring of 75 million jobs, by China, to places where it's cheaper and where environmental regulations are low - places like Ethiopa, Senegal and Kenya, who now have vast economies zones and factories.However, improving the education and health of the millions of urban poor in China so that they can aspire to be astronauts or computer whizz kids , and can join in the consumerism that is already destroying our planet, is simplistic in the extreme.I am sorry to say that this book informs to some degree (hence 2 stars) but offers no realistic insights into the future of China.
