Bad history, badly done Having read "Flyboys," I had relatively high expectations for this book, but in the end it is very disappointing. The argument is that the "China mirage," a set of myths perpetuated by the China opium traders, novelists (Pearl S. Buck), and romanticized evangelists somehow captured FDR's policy makers to cut off all oil trade to Japan in response to its brutal treatment of China. But Bradley never makes his case, indeed more careful treatments of the topic (Jeffrey Record, "A War They Knew They Would Lose") notes that strategic calculations drove Roosevelt's advisors decision to cut off oil exports, rather than the influence of the so-called China lobby. The book is marred by silly writing (Felix Frankfurter's advisors are called the "hot dogs," Dean Acheson is "the wise man," and so on. George Marshall is described as "the man who had won World War II for FDR (p. 334), disregarding the hundreds of thousands of men and women who really won the war. The book has too many errors (the Pearl Harbor commanders are described as "barely speaking to each other," disregarding Irving Janis' argument in "Groupthink" that they were in fact too close to warn each other of the pending danger of a Japanese attack. General Lemay's World War II bombers are called "B-52's," which much have been a surprise to the Vietnam B-52 flyers -- the bombers used against Japan were B-29s, completely different bombers. Chennault's aviators are dismissed, showing the author's ignorance of the Salween River campaign which stopped the Japanese advance into southern China.Because of its silly writing style, its unsupported thesis, and its numerous mistakes, this book is a great disappointment.
