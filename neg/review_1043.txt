Real Strengths and Weaknesses The ironic thing about The China Mirage is that it is at its best when discussing Japan.  The section on Baron Kaneko's courtship of Teddy Roosevelt and Japan's reaction to oil sanctions in the months leading up to Pearl Harbor are fascinating and insightfulAnd to credit the author, his main point, that Chiang Kai Shek and the Soongs aided and abetted by Henry Luce, Henry Stimson and the "China Lobby" subverted US policy on China and did a huge disservice to the Chinese people is spot on.So what are the drawbacks?  There are three main ones.  First, is the author's tendency to hit you over the head with his thesis.  He repeats his charges over and over again as if we are a jury, not book readers.  Second, his connection to Korea and especially Vietnam seems tacked on.  As a result, it is hard to evaluate his argument the the China mirage was responsible for these conflicts (I suspect it played a role but is far more complicated than the author lets on).But the biggest drawback is the minimization of the horribleness of the other choices besides Chiang in the 1930s and 1940s.  He dismisses criticism of Mao in a few sentences and thereby ignores the fact that he would go on to be one of the horrible despots of the 20th Century.  He similarly gives almost no attention to Japanese atrocities in China after the early 1930s invasion.Helping Chiang to the extent that the US did may have been a very poor choice.  But the same is true of every other choice.
