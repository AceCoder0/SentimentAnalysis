The author has done a great amount of reading Biden/Chinese emails. The problem the author has the book is a scrambled mess.  It jumps all over the place with dates, events, Biden associates and the Biden's creating the book of facts.  The book shoud have been turned over to a good editor before publishing it.  The author makes it clear the Biden's are breaking the law, but his scrambled mess left me in a state of confussion what PRC agency he is in bed with.
