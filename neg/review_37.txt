Title is deceptive -- not an epic story of China Given the pattern of Rutherford's previous books, it was deceptive to call this one China and imply it would be an epic historical fiction of China. The country has over 5,000 years of incredible history, but the book doesn't even bother with most of it, because apparently "China" didn't matter until the British showed up acting in the capacity of a drug cartel and invaded it to force the Chinese to continue to let the British cartel freely peddle addictive drugs on the Chinese. Not only is the choice of starting point and subsequent topics British-centric, but the same goes for the characters. By far the most attention is given to the British characters, with a handful of actual Chinese ones relegated to mostly supporting roles. The story itself and the characters are passably readable, but nothing special. This is not an epic story. It's very recent China through the eyes of an obvious Anglophile.
