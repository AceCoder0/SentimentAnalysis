Interesting stories but not particularly cohesive I enjoyed reading this book.  I learned a lot about China and a lot about the impact of the Communist party since it took power in 1949 (?).  But I was ultimately unsatisfied for 2 reasons:One, it felt more like a collection of interesting stories and less like a coherent book.  The stories of particular episodes in China did not seem to follow any time line or any other organizational structure.  I struggled to understand how the stories related to each other or whatever connections were implied.  The stories seemed to jump between periods in China that didn't make any sense to me.  That said, each episode was interesting and educational.Two, I kept expecting for the author to explain to the reader why China is thriving.  He provides a wealth of details about how corrupt the system is from the highest levels in Beijing to the lowest levels in each town/province/whatever.  He details how "the party" influences almost every economic decision that gets made.  He makes various statements about how this or that leader opened up China to market reforms and private property rights but in the same breath details how government at every level influences decisions.  I walked away from this book still scratching my head as to how China has grown in the past 30-ish years.  I'm still trying to figure that out.Read this book for interesting insights into China over the past 60 years.  But don't expect to have any better understanding of the big picture.
