A huge disappointment when compared to his previous novels... As a longtime Edward Rutherford fan, and as someone who has lived in China, I had been looking forward to this novel for a long time.Unfortunately, the book is only nominally about China....it's really about the Opium Wars.Whereas Rutherford's previous novels have covered hundreds of years, this novel covers roughly 70 years, with the majority of it taking place over the course of about 20 years. Likewise, a significant portion of the novel takes place outside of China, and one of the main characters is British, not Chinese.So if you're expecting a traditional Rutherford novel following several characters and their descendants through multiple centuries of Chinese history....well this isn't it.Hugely disappointing....
