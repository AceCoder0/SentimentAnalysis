Not a typical Edward Rutherfurd book. If you are a fan, you will be disappointed Not a typical Edward Rutherfurd book. If you are a fan, you will be disappointed. It is a regular, boring story compared to his other books.  I have read a lot of books about  China from Foreign and Chinese authors and this book did not ad anything to my knowledge of China's life, Culture and history.
