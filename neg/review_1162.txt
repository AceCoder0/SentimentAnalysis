Good intro to China’s geopolitical strategy, but too repetitive. Appreciated the introduction to China’s geopolitical strategy vis-vis the US, but found the author to be overly repetitive throughout. At some points, I asked myself, “Did an editor review this text?”Finished the book for my own edification, but the process felt like a chore/college reading rather than a topical text.
