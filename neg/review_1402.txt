Worrying detail errors I am troubled by factual errors and gaps.  Overall,  the author's point about US policy toward Asia being based on hope rather than reality is sound.  But factual errors like describing B52's bombing Japan in 1945 trouble me.  The author also combines events from Comodore Perry's two visits to Japan in 1853 into one single visit.  If details that are easy to check are wrong, I worry about all the other details.
