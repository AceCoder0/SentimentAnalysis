Good on how the Chinese party works, not a great read, could have used editing A good book on understanding how the Chinese communist party really works and why things are done the way they often are.  It makes one think about how to feel about what the Chinese government does, proposes to other governments and so on.  Unfortunately the book could have used a stern editor - some of it reads slowly to say the least, some of the details of examples are unnecessary or repetitious, and so on.  So not a good bedtime read as one may fall asleep.
