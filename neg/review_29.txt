Solid history research Unfortunately, compared to Rutherfurd's other works, not as strong when it came to the storytelling aspect. There's plenty to learn about Chinese history here but it would have worked better if the story had been focused mostly if not entirely on Chinese characters and their families, but this novel has much of its story based on Europeans in China during the Opium Wars to the Boxer Rebellion.It's not a bad book, but not as solid as previous novels.
