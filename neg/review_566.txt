Who will read a book that gets the basic fact wrong? I threw this book away after reading Page 6. "Nanjing Province‘？ Does this guy know anything about China at all? It seems he talked about Xinjiang. How could he misspelled Xinjiang as Nanjing？ How could he fail to see such a salient error? The West has been talking about Xinjiang for a few years so an average Joe could recognize this place now. Nanjing was China's former capital. Imagine a Japanese expert does not know Kyoto or a Russian expert does not know St. Petersburg! How come the editor also failed to see the error? I thought it must be published by an obscure publisher. How wrong I was! HarperCollins -- the Goldman Sachs of publishing! This is the status of America's China studies: ideology first, money a close second, and facts are in the ditches. Shame on the author. Shame on HarpoonCollins!
