Deliberate Leftist lies? The notion that Dean Acheson of his own volition and against the president's wishes (While FDR was out of town meeting with Churchill on the Prince of Wales) cut of all oil shipments to Japan, knowingly provoking the Japanese into starting the Pacific war would be laughable if it wasn't such a blatant lie in order to rehabilitate FDR's determination to force the Japanese to attack us. Can anyone imagine a more irresponsible act by a bureaucrat??? If Acheson had done anything remotely this devious and dis-loyal to his employer, you would expect subsequent political leaders to shun him as the worst example of a loose cannon...but no, he went on to be Truman's secretary of state and ultimately worked closely with both JFK and LBJ (Not to mention that FDR kept Acheson around afterwards and even promoted him.) Kennedy actually called Acheson to the White House to advise him on the Cuban missile crisis. (I can just imagine the conversation JFK had with his brother, "Hey Bobby, lets get that guy Acheson in here to give us advice on this life or death situation with Russia...you know, the guy who single handidly started the Pacific war with Japan while FDR was out of town...") Bradley also spins the fanciful tale that Mao and the Chinese communists were benevolent, warm and cuddly big-brothers, a sort of  Marxist Meals-On-Wheels who treated the Chinese people with kindness and benevolence, rather than being the enormous mass-murderers history has proven them to be. The China Mirage is a mirage alright - from a distance it seems like history but is nothing more than an enormous lie.
