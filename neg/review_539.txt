Be prepared to flip back and forth!!! I was forced to give only one star because I could not go past the first 30 pages. The book is 341 pages, of these, well over 80 are "foot notes". To really grasp what the book is addressing, the reader has to read two sentence then flip to the end to read the appropriate "note". Each page has an average of 10 -plus notes! That means that on a typical page, the reader has to flip to the end of the book ten times to read the appropriate note. As I mentioned, I had to put the book down after reading only 30 pages of text and referring to note number 1 to note number 99!
