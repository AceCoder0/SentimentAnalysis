Missing the globalist problem Lots of eye-opening info in this book, but the underlying theme seems to be "Why are these Americans helping China and betraying their home country?"  I bet Schweizer understands better now, as so many of us do, that the globalist elite (the World Economic Forum grads, the Bidens, the Trudeaus, the Bushes, the Obamas, the Clintons, etc.) have no loyalty to the U.S. because they seek to "build back better" or "level up" to a New World Order / one world government wherein they reign.  Along these lines, Schweizer's treatment of Gates is quite naive.  Similarly, his "what can we do" chapter suggests that the press can help shed light on problems, but of course we've found out this past year that a bought & paid for media is a huge part of the problem.  So, it's a helpful collection of information, but the analysis of forces in play is weak.
