Poorly structured and dour. Before continuing I have to admit that I am only 28% the way through this book - one that I was looking forward to reading. Unfortunately the product itself is sub-par. One might expect a more engaging, structured book from a professional writer, alas, 'The Party' rambles on in the manner of a dissertation written the night before due - the chapters are (typically) excessively long with several muddled and disjointed points crammed into each. Whatever the author's intentions this is not the best way to get one's point across.
