The China That Blinds James Bradley wrote one of my favorite books in Flags of Our Fathers, so I’ve always had it in mind to read his other works when time allowed. In the China Mirage, Bradley argues that the Roosevelt's (Teddy and FDR most prominently) had a special relationship and feeling towards China, which is based on false notions of greed, imperialism, and racism. This relationship and feeling had a significant influence on US policy making for about a 40 year period, even when evidence suggested the foolishness of such policy.This one did not grab me in the way that the highly personal Flags of Our Fathers did because that book was highly intimate and allowed me as a reader to get invested. Furthermore, the use of nicknames suggested a certain friendliness that probably should not exist between an author and the subject particularly when one makes the type of claims, which Bradley makes.But what of the actual claims? It is possible that the United States and China have a special relationship. As a country, we have special relationships with others (Israel, Great Britain), but this book seems to argue that without the Roosevelt's, US policy in China during the period would have been different. I’m not sure there would have been a ton of difference. America has often believed “The enemy of my enemy is my friend” and aided those who were fighting our enemies.Call it an inconclusive case.
