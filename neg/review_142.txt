Not his usual I'm a huge Rutherford fan but China disappointed me and I'm struggling to get through it. I was expecting his usual epic spanning centuries of ancient China. What I got was 61 years out of the 1800s of the opium trade and the British empire's part in it.  I don't know why he has changed his writing style.  I hope it's a fluke and future books won't be like China.  China has made me leary of buying Rutherford books in advance in the future.
