An initial egregious error I like the book and the work that went into it. But did no one, I mean no one, catch the error on page 6 where he states "They are currently on display in Nanjing province, where they are violently repressing millions."?!?! First of all, Nanjing is a city (the capital of Jiangsu province), not a province. He should have written "Xinjiang," which is where the Uighurs live. It bothers me that such a blatant error got through so many levels of writing and editing...
