An Inadvertent Mirage of Chinese Communists To unveil the China Mirage, the author inadvertently created a Mirage of the Chinese Communist Party(CCP). While there were many astounding facts in this book, the author failed to recognize the most fatal character of CCP, DECEPTION. Behind the happy new farm workers were the many murdered, suicided, or imprisoned land owners of generations, who not only lost the land without any compensation but wore a political scarlet letter for life and for the whole family and descendants. In the front line of the CCP army during the civil wars against the Nationalist were the innocent civilians whom CCP used as their shields and would never be able to complain. Who is best at staging for foreign visitors? CCP has been doing it for decades and still does. I hope the author has seen the deadly consequences of helping the CCP strive by now, especially after COVID-19 virus outbreak. Lots of the world organizations are controlled by China now and started to malfunction: WTO, WHO, just to name a few. The world order is now a mirage because of CCP's participation.In contrast, the Nationalists, who were corrupted and chased out of China landed in Taiwan. Taiwan had land reform too. But land owners were compensated. Taiwan has since evolved into a mature democracy following Lincoln's and Sun, Yat-Sen's three principles (of the people, by the people, for the people),  which the author ridiculed.  Though not a country of Christen majority, Taiwanese enjoy and value freedom of religion and speech, civil rights, right of property and among others  as the American. Taiwan has a world-envy health system and is proudly holding crucial and leading positions in modern technologies such as semi-conductor and computer hardware. There are still many mountains to climb for Taiwan. But Taiwan has proven CCP is never the right choice of Chinese ally for Americans at any time, in the past or at present.
