which has many good points of history I just finished his earlier book The Imperial Cruise & started on this book, which has many good points of history. My problem is that I'm halfway thru the book & Bradley seems not to have one good thing to say about the Chiangs or Soongs & nothing but praise for Mao. You get engrossed in the story so his slant is very subtle. He enumerates every (supposed) flaw of the  Chiangs & Soongs but Mao is described as having "extraordinary courage" & "with a stroke of genius" and in general, as a great friend of the noble peasants. But some estimates put Mao's genocide of his beloved peasants at 200 million. Every depiction by Bradley of Mao shows his good treatment of the people & every depiction of Chiang kai-shek is of mistreatment.It seems a dose of truth could be seen by comparing life in Taiwan vs pre-Westernized era of China (before Nixon). Life for Taiwanese was/is much better than those of Mainland China. Author also says Mayling was hypocritical in pushing citizens to stop smoking--while privately she was a chain-smoking fiend. That's possible but seems unlikely considering her lifelong youthful appearance, and the fact  she lived to be a 106. It's a small detail but challenges the author's credibility. His constant praise of Mao & disdain of Chiang seems to show a virulent leftist slant.I've been studying WWI & II for the past 2.5 years & have discovered that so much of American history is watered down nonsense. The appeal of Bradley's book to me was the promise of being "hidden history," which is where the greater truth of history is found. He does give some of that, but its not the deeper layer of truth I hoped for. And praise of Mao is crazy myth making, no doubt many in America's increasingly socialist population will be taken in by that.
