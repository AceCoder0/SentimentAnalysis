Not great I read about two thirds and stopped. If I was to be generous, the book was a good idea.I just didn't like the writing style. I found it bordering on smug and self satisfied. It read, at points, how I imagine an overcooked Mills and Boon might read.If you like low brow Victorian pastiche, then this is the book for you!
