Simplistic, Ideological Polemics Bradley has a simple, black and white world view: CCP and Mao: good; Japan: bad; America: bad, and a little stupid. Roosevelt may not have been perfect, but he didn’t kill tens of millions of his own people via the Great Leap Forward or the Cultural Revolution like Bradley’s hero Mao. This book could have been commissioned by the CCP but I’m certain it wasn’t - if it had been, it would have been more subtle and nuanced. Based on the China Mirage, I’m taking Flags of our Fathers to Goodwill. It’s been in my “to read” pile, but there are so many books, and so few hours in the day..
