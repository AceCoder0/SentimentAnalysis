Repetitive, not all that insightful Admittedly, I have only read the first third or so and the chapter on U.S.- China relations, but I think that sufficient to say that this an excessively repetitive book that stagnates for paragraph after paragraph stating the same point just said by different Chinese sources.  I suppose that is his intention, to document ad nauseum, but he does not compensate with much analytical insight that is novel or additive.  Also, I have yet to see any on the ground reporting or even interviews with Chinese officials...with the proviso I noted above.
