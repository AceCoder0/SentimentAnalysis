Repetitious - Long - China by Edward Rutherford was a good book but it got boring at times.  I did expect to learn more about China and its many traditions/customs. I did learn some.  The opium trade was a big part of the book and the war between the British.  I did get some info about t heir many traditions - but it didn't go far enough.  I read one book of Mr Rutherford and that was Paris - that was a fantastic read - I read it a whole lot faster and found it more interesting.
