Obviously an extremely biased viewpoint When you talk about how the US is always a positive force in the world and refuse to accept that others do not agree, there is no question that it is biased. The US has so many problems. and it does not really practice what it preaches. Its aim is obviously maintaining global hegemony and not anything altruistic, and it always never listens to other countries concerns about its aims. Listening is something the US cannot do, and it tries to force its flawed system on other countries. What the US excels at is having the highest incarceration rate in the world, spending more of its GDP on medical without descent medical. The  US is not a democracy in the strict sense and that seems to be forgotten. What is even worse is that the rich control the country as proven by a study done by princeton which is a big reason that the rich are so rich in the country while the middle class is declining, there are so many homeless, and the poverty rate is 17.8% vs 0.6 percent according to both the World Bank and CIA. China has responded the way it has because it recognized that the US is a threat because if the GDP per capita of Chinese reaches that of Japan, Taiwan, or South Korea, then the Chinese GDP would be twice the United States and the GDP PPP would be much higher. That would ruin American economic global political hegemony which eventually would destroy its political hegemony. There has been a lot of wisdom behind the leadership of China, and it recognizes that the US will not accept a successful China--it will do everything it can to destroy China since only an impoverished China would not be a threat to American hegemony.
