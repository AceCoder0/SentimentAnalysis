Not what  hoped for I have read and enjoyed several of Edward Rutherford's historical novels. I began reading China looking forward to a similar experience. Unfortunately this was far from what happened.This book does not have any of the flavor one might expect in to find in an exotic and interesting place and era. The plot, characters and situations are cardboard stereotypes.Life is too short and interesting for me to invest any more time reading this book.
