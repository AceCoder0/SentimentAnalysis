Not What i was Expecting After reading all the reviews and seeing the author interviewed several times I purchased this book expecting it to rock the planet.  While the information is useful, the book makes almost no allegations of law-breaking (Hunter didn't register as a foreign agent, big whoop).  If you want to know exactly how Congress has written the laws to allow themselves to legally get rich at the expense of These United States of America, then you won't be disappointed, but will likely be dismayed.  What has been happening should be criminal, but it is not.  Helping other nations succeed is admirable....selling your country down the road in the process is the very definition of treason.  China owns us!  Future generations will pay the price of our generation's greed.
