An author in full decline:  Not Recommended Because I liked James Bradley's first two books  (Flyboys & Flag of our Fathers) I read Imperial Cruise (which I have reviewed on Amazon). It was terrible and the research, Aryan theory of the world, unrelenting anti-Western theme plus his complete omission of the American Civil War were exceptionally poor. But any author can write a bad book. Mistakenly I read China Mirage.  This time I could not make myself finish it.  Bradly's authorship and scholarship as evidenced by his last two books are in full decline. Do not waste your time on this book.
