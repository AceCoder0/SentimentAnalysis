Thomas","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Balanced and nuanced analysis of a complex situation","2023年2月4日 在美国审核","","There is no shortage of books by ""China experts"", but their tones generally fall into one of two categories: the China-juggernaut-get-used-to-it type and the China-will-collapse-within-X-months type. This book succumbs to neither extreme, but presents a detailed and nuanced analysis of both the dangers which China presents and the challenges it faces. The fresh take which Brands and Beckley offer is the conclusion that the very structural weaknesses which menace China should not be a source of complacency or gloating in the West, but cause for grave concern, since it is ascendant powers that perceive windows of opportunity closing who are most dangerous. They don’t offer specifics about what China will do next (though they make some educated guesses), but instead try to help the reader understand the complex web of pressures acting on China, and how they are likely to respond. I found this a good companion to Steven Mosher’s /Hegemon/ to help me grasp the distinctive and non-Western mindset of the Chinese.Brands and Beckley propose solutions that the West can follow to blunt China’s impact. Whether the West has the unified will and moral fiber to implement them is another question, but that wasn’t the focus of this book.","1 个人发现此评论有用","报告","显示条评论","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2F1324021306%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_arp_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26csrfT%3DhI8EFG2KtlbEdB2443gbM3Lrl8btyA3BxF5ghp9Gx5D3AAAAAGQvwjEAAAAB%26reviewId%3DRXEVH6E44IJ3P&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hI8EFG2KtlbEdB2443gbM3Lrl8btyA3BxF5ghp9Gx5D3AAAAAGQvwjEAAAAB&reviewId=RXEVH6E44IJ3P","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

And that's all the good things I can say about it.The main point is clear, that China will decline very soon, and therefore it will seize its chance before it's gone.The problem is, when you do strategic analysis, you need to analyze a player's strength and weakness relative to its opponents/competitors.The main reasons behind the authors' ""decline predictions"" include shrinking population, debts, stagnation in innovation, and geopolitical encirclement. The problem is, how does China do relative to its opponents/competitors.- Demographics: Sure, China's population will shrink very soon, if not already. But that's a problem with Japan, Korea, Taiwan and EU as well. US still has population growth, but its problems are in the population structure (racial mix, illegal immigrants, etc.).- Debt: Well, do people really think the US or Japan are doing a lot better?-  Stagnation in innovation: Again, it's a universal problem. In addition, in technological stagnation, followers like China can actually do better by taking the proven paths, while leaders like the US have no where else to go.- Geopolitical issues: Think about how well the US is doing in the middle east, Africa and Ukraine.  Therefore, the authors' analyses don't contain much value. For China haters, you can get some emotional lift out of it, but that's it, don't expect intellectual gains. In addition, the book is just a lengthy version of authors' article ""The End of China’s Rise Beijing Is Running Out of Time to Remake the World"" (Foreign Affairs, Oct 2021). The readers interested in the topic can just read that article and save their time and money.","4 个人发现此评论有用","报告","显示条评论","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2F1324021306%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhBt0nRGG8vS0ysxY6Q9V4aWRMj5GsX8rule5J%252Bz5z3OAAAAAAGQvwrsAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR1ZLDH3WUH7X5J&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hBt0nRGG8vS0ysxY6Q9V4aWRMj5GsX8rule5J%2Bz5z3OAAAAAAGQvwrsAAAAB&reviewId=R1ZLDH3WUH7X5J","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
