"wsmrer","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","No time soon ....","2014年9月26日 在美国审核","已确认购买","There is no need to add to the praise of McGregor's work other than to say he brought with him a Sovietologist background when he turned to the Chinese Communist Party that allowed him to see what many others have missed and that is the core embedded Leninist principles as the foundation of the CCP's mode of operation at all levels of activity. As the term Communist has been washed away in western dialog about the Peoples Republic of China McGregor never makes that mistake. His work is a brilliant analysis of the strengths and weakness of the system and he lists the many forecasts that have been made of its inevitable demise but it is worth quoting his final conclusions.""It has always been easy to construct scenarios under which the Party loses power. A financial crisis was a favoured one for years. As it turned out, the great financial crisis of the early twenty-first century came to symbolize the eclipse of the west, and China's rise, rather than the other way round.... Within China, the country's distinctive system is not a source of concern. Rather, it is played up as a point of pride. The Global Times, the nationalistic tabloid owned by the People's Daily, the Party's mouthpiece, trumpets how China's rise has ended the post-Cold-War `unilateral' world lorded over by the USA. `The biggest contribution that China has made to world politics is that through revolution, reform and development China has shown the world that the Western model is not the only way to modernize,' it said in an opinion piece in October 2009. `China has also demonstrated that the non-Western world does not necessarily follow the West's footsteps.' The editorial captured a longtime article of faith in China that is only now becoming evident in a western world still recuperating from the financial crisis. The end of the Cold War did not mean the end of history after all. The Chinese communist system is, in many ways, rotten, costly, corrupt and often dysfunctional. The financial crisis has added a dangerous dash of hubris to the mix. But the system has also proved to be flexible and protean enough to absorb everything that has been thrown at it, to the surprise and horror of many in the west. In the absence of democratic elections and open debate, it is impossible to judge popular support for the Party with any degree of accuracy. But it is indisputable since Mao's death that the twin foundations of the Party's power-economic growth and resurgent nationalism-have been strengthened. China has long known something that many in developed countries are only now beginning to grasp, that the Chinese Communist Party and its leaders have never wanted to be the west when they grow up. For the foreseeable future, it looks as though their wish, to bestride the world as a colossus on their own implacable terms, will come true.""This is 2014, the year another approach by Neo-Marxist analysts* list as the likely date of the collapse of the Chinese economy for its similarities to western capitalists systems.They might reevaluate all their conclusions regarding China if they were to see what McGregor was capable of seeing; a mixed economy with a dynamic non-state sector harnessed to a vibrant state sector like no other communist model.To quote again: ""The Party's genius has been its leaders' ability in the last three decades to maintain the political institutions and authoritarian powers of old-style communism, while dumping the ideological straitjacket that inspired them. The Party's conscious retreat from the private lives of Chinese citizens over the same period had a similarly liberating effect on society. The dehumanization of everyday life that characterized traditional communist societies has largely disappeared in China, along with the food queues. In the process, the Party has pulled off a remarkable political feat, somehow managing to hitch the power and legitimacy of a communist state to the drive and productivity of an increasingly entrepreneurial economy.The visible hand of the state and the invisible hand of the market, far from being contradictory, are made to complement and reinforce each other.""* See Endless Crisis: How Monopoly-Finance Capital Produces Stagnation and Upheaval from the USA to ChinaFoster, John Bellamy; McChesney, Robert W.

"A. Menon","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Illuminating introduction to arguably the most important political party in the world","2010年10月30日 在美国审核","已确认购买","Politics in China can be often opaque to foreigners.  In some sense it is surprising the lack of literature on the Chinese Communist Party and the means in which it functions, but as illustrated in this book, much happens behind closed doors.  If one wants an introduction to the party as well as the way in which it governs and integrates itself then this serves perfectly.  After reading this one gets a better perspective on how the party operates, the stresses that it deals with, how it has adapted in the past and what it is dealing with today.The Party uses both example and commentary to show by example how the Party is behind some of the major business decisions of recent history.  It gives examples of how the Party directly influences some of the biggest corporates on the planet.  In particular the rotation of the CEOs of the 3 biggest chinese telco operators was done behind closed doors without consultation with the public.  It discusses Chalco's impact on disrupting one of the biggest potential mergers in modern business history (Rio and BHP), as such a merger would shift bargaining power of mineral prices away from consumer (china) and towards producer.  Its actions need to be assessed through the lense of an entity who is both asserting and preserving its power as well as protecting its sovereign interests.The Party also discusses the internal stresses faced by the communist party.  With the phenomenal success of the chinese economy and the wealth that has been created with growth comes greater competition between the lure of the party, and the desire for commercial wealth.  This stress has been a source of corruption and rent seeking.  With economies directed from the bottom up with preferential state lending, the position of power of local authorities can and is used for personal benefit.  The party it is argued acknowledges and accepts this.  It must deal with both punishing examples to show vigilance but realizing that removing the rents that are recieved with political power would remove the incentive to join and thus would promote instability.Overall this is a fascinating overview of how the Chinese Communist Party operates and what it has to deal with.  It has had to adapt quickly, and the stresses it is dealing with will likely intensify over time.  The way in which the party maintains its power is on a tightrope in which differences in opinion within the party are abundant.  Nonetheless they have so far been able to form consensus and progress despite their differences.  It is the ability to unify and come to consensus that has taken them this far, despite some near break points.  Whether that will continue to be the case, time will tell, but as an overview on what is happening today and some of the solutions the party has crafted, this book is excellent.  It is a must read to gain perspective into how the communist party operates and how it sees things.","2 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB083ZLHL6T%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_arp_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26csrfT%3DhOmRfZKLtNA8qAFw7eoCyPMwVtJuOO442y1UgAI69vxuAAAAAGQvy34AAAAB%26reviewId%3DR151GQCWTETASB&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hOmRfZKLtNA8qAFw7eoCyPMwVtJuOO442y1UgAI69vxuAAAAAGQvy34AAAAB&reviewId=R151GQCWTETASB","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
"Serge J. Van Steenkiste","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Party Keen on Stealth Exposed to Sunlight","2010年7月7日 在美国审核","已确认购买","Richard McGregor renders a great service to his readers by shedding light on the inner workings of the ruling Chinese Communist Party which is keen on secrecy.  The transformation of China's economy and society and its impact on the rest of the world in the last three decades has too often deflected attention from formal politics in Beijing.Highly pragmatic, cynical, and adaptive, the Party has succeeded in the last three decades in linking the power and legitimacy of a communist state with the drive and productivity of an increasingly entrepreneurial society.  The party's legitimacy still depends largely on the economy and its accompanying resurgent patriotism and nationalism.  For all its increasingly international presence, China and, therefore, the Party will remain focused mainly on solving the country's problems due to their scale, depth, multiplicity, and variety.McGregor shows systematically how high secrecy, tolerance of non-embarrassing corruption in its ranks, resolute hostility to the rule of law, and vindictive pursuit of enemies are all vital for the Party if it wants to remain at the core of the modern Chinese narrative through its tight grip on 1) personnel, 2) propaganda, and 3) People's Liberation Army.At the same time, the Party has traded in Mao Zedong's totalitarian terror for a seductive modus vivendi with Chinese citizens.  As long as ordinary Chinese accept the enlightened leadership of their empowered elite and do not ask for either accountability or the rule of law, they can pretty much lead their life and career as they see fit and eventually get rich.  McGregor also shows clearly that although the Party has adapted its membership make-up to ongoing changes in China, it is struggling to keep up with the rapidly evolving aspirations, demands, and cleavages of the Chinese society.  However, the bargain that the Party has struck with ordinary Chinese does not exist in a vacuum.  The Party's propaganda system has to constantly remind Chinese citizens that there is no serious alternative to the Party in order for it to remain at the top of Chinese society.The Party is also keen to minimize its profile abroad.  For example, the Party likes to promote the largest state-owned enterprises (SOEs) that are publicly traded in Hong Kong and outside mainland China as independent commercial entities.  The Party's myriad functions, starting with its control over top management of these SOEs, have been downplayed systematically.In summary, McGregor convincingly demonstrates that the Party is determined to pursue its own model of economic, political, and social development on its own implacable terms.  The rest of the world, especially the West, has no other option but to adapt to the reemergence of China, regardless of the ultimate outcome of this metamorphosis.","12 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB083ZLHL6T%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_arp_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26csrfT%3DhG3tlc5zI2LdzkO1YwYkVv46eofE%252F8AYZV7IBlTc4V5NAAAAAGQvy34AAAAB%26reviewId%3DR3P40KUZV6VZ61&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hG3tlc5zI2LdzkO1YwYkVv46eofE%2F8AYZV7IBlTc4V5NAAAAAGQvy34AAAAB&reviewId=R3P40KUZV6VZ61","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
"James R. Leighton","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Communism--a primer on the Chinese version","2012年3月4日 在美国审核","已确认购买","This book is a real head turner or should I say an eye turner for those looking for an up to date description of how the Communist Party in China controls industry from top to bottom of its society. But if you are looking for a description of original communist theory as postulated by  Marxist-Leninist principals then a book on that subject may better suit your needs.But what you can learn from this book is exactly how the Chinese have managed to slowly change their industrial policies to a combination of of communism and capitalism.The author takes you on and interesting insiders view of how corruption, incompetance, and politics have been woven together to create one of the most productive societies in the world. It even in some cases mirrors some of the things going on in our own society which could if left unchecked could lead to the demise of our economic system to the level of China's.The author describes the major departments of Chinese Government and the role each plays in maintaining control of both the industries and the people. The most interesting is the Department of Organization which in our society would be the Personnel Department. It is there that people are selected for positions in government and the private sector. However this department functions with no rhyme or reason and does so simply through the buying and selling of jobs by people who want jobs or in some cases want to lose theirs by crossing this department the wrong way. There is no merit system in China, major players are selected simply by corruption, incompetance  or through politics. And if you should happen to be selected for a high level or sometimes a lower lever job you are assigned a Communist party member to watch you to make sure you tow the Party line. Sometimes the CEO and your assigned party member are regarded as being at the same level of power in a company or government agency. Talk about confusion about lines of authority and role in society. Imagine writing a job description for those jobs. Sometimes the party member is also the CEO. So he gets to watch himself. Obviously he is not going to report on himself. This opens the door to the question as to how China even functions in any productive way but it does this through deceit,lies, and the general ignorance of its population.  What an eye opening book!! A must read for all Americans.","1 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB083ZLHL6T%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_arp_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26csrfT%3DhNIQGIhExtlECH3HzHsuCy1eBxFOkHojJkh5GWLYbttwAAAAAGQvy34AAAAB%26reviewId%3DR1SY8IQNNMA94G&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hNIQGIhExtlECH3HzHsuCy1eBxFOkHojJkh5GWLYbttwAAAAAGQvy34AAAAB&reviewId=R1SY8IQNNMA94G","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
"Canuck in Toronto","4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Highly recommended reading for anyone working in China, investing in China, interested in China","2015年3月15日 在美国审核","已确认购买","This is one of the most well researched and chronicled books on the impact that the Communist Party has over all things in China. The author has meticulously researched (from Chinese and non-Chinese sources) the topic and the major structures of one of the most closed, opaque political systems in the world.Even though the central leadership, standing committee memberships and politburo has changed (as of 2012), this is still highly relevant to many of the themes that the Party continues to struggle with and confront. This includes the growing middle class and income disparity, State-Owned versus Private Corporation governance, environmental issues, the major anti-corruption campaign underway. And this books helps understand why these dominate the party, and why the party behaves the way it does. And the author does this in a very effective manner - well organized, well researched, and well sourced. The chapters on the Shanghai Gang are also very informative as it allows the reader to understand the massive struggle Xi Jinping must of had (continues to have) in installing his key officials into key posts that will help him with his policy agenda.Highly recommend this for anyone doing business in China (or with Chinese companies), travelling or planning to live in China as this book provides a very well-rounded view of the key decision making body that is present throughout all aspects of life in this interesting country.","6 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB083ZLHL6T%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_arp_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26csrfT%3DhBWElgXtFdLFxevDYZ%252F4jyv3HvF2To17BRrm%252Bacge0GwAAAAAGQvy34AAAAB%26reviewId%3DRC3UJWSQL4A49&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hBWElgXtFdLFxevDYZ%2F4jyv3HvF2To17BRrm%2Bacge0GwAAAAAGQvy34AAAAB&reviewId=RC3UJWSQL4A49","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
"S P","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","A Look Inside a Political Institution","2011年3月9日 在美国审核","已确认购买","The subtitle might throw you off. This is not so much a book about individual personalities, although individual stories provide the basis for analysis. It's more about the institutional workings of a massive, nimble, confusing, calculating organization that influences the daily lives of over a billion people. This book will give you a sense of the magnitude of exactly what the Chinese Community Party can do, how its role has changed, and simply how much you don't know about it. McGregor develops a clear opinion from the first page, and builds upon that image in every subsequent anecdote. Thus, the chapter of the People's Liberation Army stands not so much for itself, but how it reflects the dominance of the party.Along these lines, the book is relatively light on historical detail. It's more about individual stories and how they reflect greater trends. Don't look to this book for any comprehensive narrative. Think of it as a look inside the mind of a Chinese leader. If you are not already familiar with the history of the PRC, you could use some background. But this book will help put trends in context, giving you a basis for further studies about communist rule. Before you study isolated facts and specific leaders, it helps to have a book like this that gives you a picture of the underlying structure that defines and drives the party as a whole. The content itself is perhaps not even the book's strength. Rather it is the gripping style, intended to paint a picture and tell a story rather than lecture. Think of McGregor as a tutor, trying to teach you so you really understand. Ultimately, this is his great success: proving convincingly that the current party in power on the Mainland is persistent, flexible, and completely pervasive.","12 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB083ZLHL6T%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_arp_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26csrfT%3DhDbRmEpZn3f5lAFOO8nv8KTZqlYk755OqzcKL9X0NOApAAAAAGQvy34AAAAB%26reviewId%3DR1MPZT4HYC54OO&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hDbRmEpZn3f5lAFOO8nv8KTZqlYk755OqzcKL9X0NOApAAAAAGQvy34AAAAB&reviewId=R1MPZT4HYC54OO","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
"meyestone","4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Required reading!","2012年9月6日 在美国审核","已确认购买","This is a very readable, fascinating book that puts together what a lot of people who pay any attention to China already know - yet perhaps fail to ""appreciate"".  The central premise is that the CCP works very hard, and largely successfully, to stay behind the scenes, and to run the country through nominal governmental, judicial and legislative entities that are for all practical purposes ""front"" organizations with no independent power.  It makes one appreciate how the rule of law really is the underlying basis for all liberty.  The next time I'm confronted with a bureaucratic rule being blindly enforced by an unsympathetic bureaucrat... I will try to appreciate how much better that is than having to deal with party officials with almost unlimited power to decide whether to be helpful or obstructive based on their own discretion.The book itself is very readable.  There are a couple of places where the writing is a bit repetitive -- chapter introductions are like ""executive summaries"" of each chapter.  My Kindle edition had a small number of typographical errors that did not interfere with the book's overall readability.If you do business with China, or are interested in China, or have views on how the west interacts politically with China, you really ought to read this book to help inform your understanding of the fascinating country and state that is modern China.","1 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB083ZLHL6T%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_arp_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26csrfT%3DhEp8y0iRWZ0NfpFIASUwQMRZTGxT1EGaXFYxKA2%252Fn5ceAAAAAGQvy34AAAAB%26reviewId%3DR3DC4WW84YWCSW&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hEp8y0iRWZ0NfpFIASUwQMRZTGxT1EGaXFYxKA2%2Fn5ceAAAAAGQvy34AAAAB&reviewId=R3DC4WW84YWCSW","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

Invariably these two goals are in conflict with each other.  Competence requires openness, tolerance, diversity, transparency, accountability, and merit -- principles and ideas that stand counter to Party orthodoxy.  And so while Chinese state-owned enterprises and the Chinese military look like behemoths to the outside world, it's this very inconsistency and contradiction that weakens their ability to compete on a global scale.","6 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB083ZLHL6T%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_arp_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26csrfT%3DhExtvMjZRFiET7mcuPkHqfpIXqHwJU%252Bpn5xpSVOK2gGIAAAAAGQvy34AAAAB%26reviewId%3DR1E0NKBNVYVW50&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hExtvMjZRFiET7mcuPkHqfpIXqHwJU%2Bpn5xpSVOK2gGIAAAAAGQvy34AAAAB&reviewId=R1E0NKBNVYVW50","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

However, McGregor opens up your mind to a lot of the workings and structure of the CCP. He does a wonderful job at taking you methodically through the different bodies of the CCP and into a brief highlight of the history of some of its more prominent members. I would recommend this to anyone that has any curiosity about the Chinese Communist Party and would like to get a decent understanding of its workings. A caveat, however, is that McGregor could only unearth so much about the Party simply because knowledge about the Party is difficult to come by. Don't go in expecting to get a good understanding of its inner workings like you would somewhere like a similar book about the United States government. However, after reading the book you will be much more enlightened than coming into it.","14 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB083ZLHL6T%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_arp_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26csrfT%3DhOrgylXDAshWtEYM%252BgE9tRy6EF4y1k3ulf2BrY1LfzW1AAAAAGQvy34AAAAB%26reviewId%3DRUJLX2EZNYCIU&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hOrgylXDAshWtEYM%2BgE9tRy6EF4y1k3ulf2BrY1LfzW1AAAAAGQvy34AAAAB&reviewId=RUJLX2EZNYCIU","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
"Alex Noble","4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","A Great read","2012年8月3日 在美国审核","已确认购买","There are many books out there on China and on Chinese Communism. Most of them deal with the 20th century and end before 2000. Most are broad stroke histories and rarely get into the nitty gritty of the party workings. Then along comes 'The Party', one of the best contemporary histories of modern China and of the Party that runs China. It goes a long way to giving you the best possible understanding of the current Chinese political system, also why and how it operates. Albeit from a western perspective, you still find out more about the reasons behind the Party's decision making process than in other publications.Well written and simple to digest, if you were thinking of doing business or moving to work in China, this is a perfect book for anybody wanting to get to grips with it's system.My only gripe is that I think it could have been a little longer. It also leaves out some important subjects like Falun Gong, North Korea and Fishing boat disputes in the sea of Japan.That said, it's still possibly the best buy on the subject currently so I highly recommend it to anybody interested.","报告","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB083ZLHL6T%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhIzmxj3CrncvuvFbXRlGEVSS5jXLR7yDEbskJheharhzAAAAAGQvy5UAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR18R8AICT81V35&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","显示条评论","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hIzmxj3CrncvuvFbXRlGEVSS5jXLR7yDEbskJheharhzAAAAAGQvy5UAAAAB&reviewId=R18R8AICT81V35","","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

"nonyo_buzzyness","4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","This book was eye opening for me","2016年2月28日 在美国审核","已确认购买","A very interesting and descriptive book about China. Things have changed in China but the media uses the same words such as ""communists"" and ""dictators"" as they did decades ago. The book describes the relaxation of state control over individuals and what it takes now to have the state crack down on an individual. The China media and the US media take the same approach to many news stories that are not politically correct. They let them die rather than censor them.  After reading the book I would say that China is a democracy where only 10% of the people can vote and where the leaders have to work their way up as managers in different provinces for 30 years before they can hope to make it to top party positions.  Then they share power and have to step down after two terms.  The MSM calls China a 'dictatorship' but can't name the 'dictator.'","1 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB083ZLHL6T%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhPgrf2ggFJy52zn5FAA6UwL60OYmuwHxCQjbM4xgs3mdAAAAAGQvy5UAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR2RD9O5ZFRONK0&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hPgrf2ggFJy52zn5FAA6UwL60OYmuwHxCQjbM4xgs3mdAAAAAGQvy5UAAAAB&reviewId=R2RD9O5ZFRONK0","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
"jbd","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","The reality underneath the facade","2011年4月22日 在美国审核","已确认购买","This book will change your understanding of China.  McGregor's main theme is that China is coming to look more and more like Western societies on the surface, with similar market and other institutions--but as he shows repeatedly, under the surface the country still runs on Soviet hardware.  He tells his story with panache.Most fascinating and original is how he describes the continuing control the party still has over the commanding heights of the economy, particularly over publicly traded companies.  The book is brimming with fascinating anecdotes to back up its claims.  I particularly enjoyed the story of how the Party decided to simply switch the management teams of two publicly traded companies that were competing against each other in the same industry, practically overnight; it's as if you awoke one morning to find that the top management of Ford and GM had simply switched places with each other.  Dorothy, this isn't Kansas.The highest praise for a book on current affairs is that it will change the way you think, and what you understand when you read the newspaper.  This book accomplishes both.I'm baffled as to how anyone could give it fewer than five stars.  Yes, it doesn't tell a seemless story, but that's not the nature of the material.  A fun and penetrating read.","18 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB083ZLHL6T%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhEIAQXmFpPFzZQ4eRUDOU%252BU%252BM%252BNMXXaimU7xDpu553Y8AAAAAGQvy5UAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR1GVMVFJ79OIGK&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hEIAQXmFpPFzZQ4eRUDOU%2BU%2BM%2BNMXXaimU7xDpu553Y8AAAAAGQvy5UAAAAB&reviewId=R1GVMVFJ79OIGK","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

They could just as easily have been at the beginning. Consider them as book ends for an Alice's Wonderlandisque journey, deep into a land where the societal norms and institutions look familiar, it's just that they function upside down. Take corruption for instance: ""Corruption in China seems to operate like a transaction tax that distributes ill-gotten gains among the ruling class.""Richard McGregor gives the reader, through many years of living in China and many in-depth interviews with those in industry and politics, a very informative and up to date look into the people who run this massive country.This reviewer originally had the image of a cast of marionettes on strings, controlled by a few master puppeteers. Makes one wonder if there may be an old Chinese proverb,  something about a string can be pulled from either end.

"K. P. Butler","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Excellent behind-the-scenes look at ""corporate China""","2012年7月26日 在美国审核","已确认购买","This is a well-written glimpse of the behind-the-scene influence of the Chinese communist party in ostensibly ""private"" companies that have drawn so much foreign investment. Essentially, the power of the Party relies on the power to pick who runs the firms. Although a company may have a Western-style governance structure, with a board of directors including Westerners, those rules and decision-makers will be quickly ignored when the company's interests contradict those of the Party. The author notes one instance when the Party reassigned the CEOs of several cell phone companies, making CEO of Company A CEO of Company B, etc., and CEO of Company B CEO of Company A, in a game of musical chairs --- and the CEOs had no say in the matter and were surprised by the move. The author aptly states that it would be like the CEO of AT&T being forced one day to become the CEO of Verizon, and the Verizon CEO assuming the lead role at AT&T. Although China is a clearly a rising economic force, lost in the hype of China Inc. and the praise of privatization is the reality that the Party remains very much in control. Highly recommended.","1 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB083ZLHL6T%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhHH%252FB5PVkKu70KRg39tcW6LWwFMOeBd1ydboEN3teijmAAAAAGQvy5UAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR3LV500WANJ59S&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hHH%2FB5PVkKu70KRg39tcW6LWwFMOeBd1ydboEN3teijmAAAAAGQvy5UAAAAB&reviewId=R3LV500WANJ59S","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

Even China experts are often puzzled by the question.Richard McGregor is no ordinary China expert.  His book ""The Party: the Secret World of China's Communist Rulers"" has solved the puzzle.The book is based on a wealth of information, including much that is not accessible to most people.  Thanks to his considerable knowledge and experiences in China and the world in general, his analysis of the information is astute and convincing. His intense curiosity and intrepid exploration has redefined investigative journalism. The readers benefit by all this.As the subject matter is so big, no one should be expected to cover all the fields.  Regrettably, the book doesn't deal adequately with how the Party controls the news. I hope he will produce another book to address this topic.If you're going to read only one book in order to understand China, this  is it.","2 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB083ZLHL6T%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhC05y3k%252BcGFDwyP4BmE4D49wEzOIHW9gsM%252BgeWncR2eJAAAAAGQvy5UAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR10TGDRYV598RH&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hC05y3k%2BcGFDwyP4BmE4D49wEzOIHW9gsM%2BgeWncR2eJAAAAAGQvy5UAAAAB&reviewId=R10TGDRYV598RH","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

There is absolutely NO rule of law in China -- the laws are just a front for outsiders. There is almost no freedom of thought or expression in China. Communism is just another failed religion maintained by totalitarianism. Think Spanish Inquisition on steroids.

"edsetiadi","4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","A crucial read to understand modern China","2022年9月10日 在美国审核","","Richard McGregor is the bureau chief for the Financial Times in Washington DC. But a lifetime ago he was once its China bureau chief, where he has reported from north Asia for nearly 2 decades and had a unique first-hand access and experience in one of the world’s most mysterious countries.And decades of reporting and building network there have culminated in the writing of this book, a some kind of behind the scene account of the secret world of China’s communist rulers. And it is an eye opener.The book shows how the Communist Party creeps into every fabric of Chinese society, it provides the structure and the personnels of the Party, the politics inside the Party, the business environment in the country, the delicate balance between profitable enterprise and meeting the Party’s political objective, its long and bloodied history (including the dark days of the famine that killed 35 million people), and the ever present cult-like worship of Mao Zedong.The book also confirms some of the well known allegations towards the Party. Such as heavy censorship over its dark past, the omitted names and events from record, the massive cover up over things that are happening (such as the denial of SARS epidemic before a foreign media blow it up), the nasty treatment over outspoken journalists or whistleblowers, how the propaganda department controls the media, even the proof of half-truths or blatant lies published by the Party to eliminate competing narratives.It also addresses the deep corruption inside the Party, and the ironic inequalities where a contrast of extreme poverty and mega riches exist inside the supposedly socialist country.But perhaps the most interesting part of the book is the name dropping of some of the lesser known personnels of the Party, but equally as instrumental as Deng Xiaoping in being the architects of modern China. Names such as Chen Yun (long-serving economic planner), Chen Yuan (the man behind China inc’s move into Africa), Zhu Rongji (the corruption eradicator who was indispensable in China’s overhaul of the banking system and its entry to the WTO), as well as the oppositions such as He Weifang (the idealist university professor) and Yang Jisheng (a journalist critical towards the Party).All in all, the book is so well written as an exposé it astonishes me how McGregor can possibly published it without getting into any trouble. But he’s still alive and free, and get to tell the truth about the Party to the world. A crucial read to really understand the puzzle piece of modern China.","报告","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB083ZLHL6T%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhODVMNE6XxxiQ0QrOcak96BmOvBswgp3JFUsbGGYexyeAAAAAGQvy5kAAAAB%26reviewId%3DRVQCV5DGDZX3I&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","显示条评论","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hODVMNE6XxxiQ0QrOcak96BmOvBswgp3JFUsbGGYexyeAAAAAGQvy5kAAAAB&reviewId=RVQCV5DGDZX3I","","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

"David Southworth","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","On the Intricacies of the Communist Party of China","2022年12月16日 在美国审核","","This 2010 book details the role the Communist Party of China plays in guiding the ship of state, as well as how the regions interact with the center, different factions within the system, and the role the party plays in shaping foreign, defense, and domestic policy. Even though the book is more than a decade old at this point, given that the system being described is almost a hundred years old and draws on far older ideas of relationships within China, there is no reason to believe the system has changed much. The author even describes what is almost assuredly the model the current Chinese leader, Xi Jinping used in establishing his first-among-equals role in China today. This book proved excellent background to anyone interested in power dynamics in China and the likely trajectory of the country while the CCP remains at the center of the power structure.","1 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB083ZLHL6T%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhO61xXvaXit0nENM%252F02QifrNhTaQgbFFstjg6T2MP953AAAAAGQvy5kAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR2ZYK4QOTJBWZC&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hO61xXvaXit0nENM%2F02QifrNhTaQgbFFstjg6T2MP953AAAAAGQvy5kAAAAB&reviewId=R2ZYK4QOTJBWZC","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

"Duane McMullen","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","A fascinating, informative look at the organism that controls one quarter of the world's population","2010年6月13日 在美国审核","","Through a series of anecdotes and interviews, largely drawn from his eight years in China as correspondent for 'The Financial Times', Richard McGregor illustrates 'the Party', a remarkable social organization which subordinates 1.3 billion people.It is a journalist's treatment rather than academic, so instead of explicitly offering analysis, Richard McGregor lets his interviews and stories largely speak for themselves.  This provides a range of interesting characters, quotes and anecdotes.  However, a side-effect is that many remarkable insights are either buried innocuously in the text or left to the reader's inference.  The story is no less fascinating for it.The picture that emerges is of a creative, adaptable, self-aware and resilient social network.  Made up of 75 million party members, one in twelve adult Chinese, this self-perpetuating elite has no legal form beyond a mention in the preamble to China's constitution.  The party exists outside the regular state apparatus and operates like a controller chip grafted into China's governing structures through party cells throughout government, the military, public companies and even private firms.Grounded in its near ubiquitous presence in the state, military, public and private spheres, the Party maintains its grip via a number of interconnected and synergistic processes.  Its personnel system allows any individual to be replaced, transferred or expelled at the will of the organism.  Party control of the military provides ultimate coercive sanction.  The Party's discipline system places members above the law even as it strengthens Party control of the behaviour of its members.  The propaganda department uses sophisticated story telling to sculpt the narrative around events to conform to the Party's best interests.Few join the party for ideological reasons.  Rather, achieving party status is to gain membership into an elite club which, provided you stay within its unwritten bounds and contribute to the goals of the organism, gives a member a form of immunity from the law and other powers and abilities not available to the average citizen.  In the corruption that is endemic in the system, everyone is guilty of something serious - from taking bribes, to tax evasion to sexual impropriety to failing to get proper permits.  Members that stray out of bounds need not be punished for the real fault, but instead for one of the many more routine transgressions that hang over the heads of almost all party members.  Were one not able to normally get away with routine transgressions, there would be little benefit to party membership.  Yet simply knowing that straying too far will result in being punished for something entirely different is enough to self-censor unwanted behaviours, in particular the unwritten ones.Self-reflexive and analytic, the party is alert to the internal and external dangers it faces and has proven able to respond to challenge with remarkable agility, creativity and effectiveness.Though the book is very much about the Party at present, in 2010, glimpses of party history serve to illustrate the nature of the organism and its ability to adapt and reinvent itself.For example, Richard McGregor declares a historic milestone the Party's peaceful and administrative transfer of power in 2002 to a new top grouping of apparatchiks.  For the first time in over 2000 years of Chinese history, China was no longer ruled by a single individual seen as a sort of a god.  Instead, the apex of China became a committee atop an organism which permeates into the whole society, with the next shifting of interchangable personalities at the top scheduled for 2012.In 1992, only ten years prior to the 2002 milestone, again demonstrating forward looking pragmatic realism, the party transformed itself on entrepreneurs - the most extreme enemies of communism - not just by allowing them to join the party, but by actively recruiting them.  Binding China's rapidly emerging entrepreneurial elites to the party provided benefits to both sides, allowing entrepreneurs more freedom from the stultifying strictures of dysfunctional state bureaucracy while reinforcing and renewing Party control on an element of Chinese society that may have come to threaten the Party's very existence.Prior to that, the shock of Tiananmen square and the fall of the former Soviet Bloc caused a wave of realistic threat assessment and self-reflection within the Party.  This lead to further creative and pragmatic changes, though not in the ways that analysts in the west might have guessed or hoped for.Given the importance of the Party in China and the growing importance of China in the world, it behooves us to better understand it.  Richard McGregor's fascinating and informative book is recommended reading for those interested in understanding not just the Party, but the modern China within which it operates.","125 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB083ZLHL6T%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhI7DAASh4JKyfkahhdEyTFK9yGWfa2Qntm%252FCPHXe8saUAAAAAGQvy50AAAAB%26reviewId%3DR394O0I98IFL7H&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hI7DAASh4JKyfkahhdEyTFK9yGWfa2Qntm%2FCPHXe8saUAAAAAGQvy50AAAAB&reviewId=R394O0I98IFL7H","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

"J. Michael Cole","4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Deep inside the Chinese Communist Party","2010年11月7日 在美国审核","","The claim that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is misunderstood by outsiders has become something of a cliche recently, conferring upon the almost 80-year-old political organization an aura of impenetrability. This dearth of knowledge has slowly been remedied, however, with the publication in recent years of solid studies on the party's philosophy, modus operandi and ability to defy the odds by remaining in power.Two new books, The Party, by former Financial Times Beijing bureau chief Richard McGregor, and The Chinese Communist Party as Organizational Emperor, by National University of Singapore professor Zheng Yongnian, make important new contributions to our understanding of this most enigmatic of political parties.Though targeting very different audiences (McGregor's style is journalistic, whereas Zheng's is overly academic), the two works reach similar conclusions as to the CCP's strategies, conclusions that had already been proposed in David Shambaugh's China's Communist Party: Atrophy and Adaptation (reviewed in the Taipei Times on May 11, 2008). The party brooks no organized opposition (what Zheng refers to as a counter-hegemony), does not tolerate the formation of political parties capable of challenging its hold on power, opposes the complete divorcing of party from state, and does not encourage the evolution of democracy as it is understood elsewhere.This said, the CCP is no monolith, as the two books clearly demonstrate, nor has it failed to comprehend the tremendous challenges that have emerged as the country modernizes and embraces capitalism. The party's decision to allow capitalists to become CCP members, which Zheng describes as an epochal development in the politics of the past century, is a case in point.This adaptability, McGregor and Zheng argue, has also had effects on the state's willingness to use force to repress dissent. Though, in the extreme, the security apparatus will not hesitate to violently quell dissent, the preferred means of oppression have become more refined and subtle, relying instead on intimidation and, with increasing success, co-optation.Intra-party democracy, or the ""accommodation of democratic elements,"" which Zheng looks at in more detail than McGregor, is also a product of the CCP's adaptability and, along with economic growth, probably the key to its survival.Both authors point to corruption, particularly among the upper ranks of the CCP, as well as unequal distribution of wealth, as posing the greatest risks to state stability and by extension to the party. McGregor and Zheng cite the demise of the Shanghai clique in the mid-1990s and the use of allegations of corruption to bring top officials to heel as examples of how the war on corruption has become intrinsic to factional politics. McGregor's description of the party apparatus in charge of investigating corruption (and the system that enables officials at the very top to avoid scrutiny) makes for particularly entertaining reading.While there isn't anything fundamentally new about the subjects addressed by the two authors, their exploration of the various CCP departments, and how they intersect and interact with the state apparatus, is very helpful, though Zheng's, which can become so detailed as to name the professors teaching specific classes in the Central Party School, will likely appeal to a very confined group of experts on China.An interesting point where the two works depart, and what makes them complementary, in a way, is in Zheng's attempt to portray the CCP not so much as an oddity, but as the product of the society in which it emerged -- hence the ""reproduction"" in the title. Throughout his book, Zheng makes the case that the CCP's approach to power is contingent on historical continuity and draws from practices implemented back when the country was ruled by emperors. Though this argument could be exploited to make a case against democratization, it nevertheless makes a valid contribution to our understanding of the party's resistance to Western-style democracy and the ostensible lack of widespread calls for such democracy among ordinary Chinese. Interestingly, we learn that Sun Yat-sen ('''), the father of the Republic of China, was also opposed to the creation of public associations outside his party and proposed the idea of ""partifying the masses"" as an alternative to independent social organizations.Ironically, as Zheng points out, historical continuity, i.e., the reproduction of the organizational emperorship, is also the main driver behind the CCP's need to adapt and embrace Marxism's nemeses, such as capitalism and democratic elements, as Chinese history is rife with examples of rigid systems being overthrown by a counter-hegemonic force. As such, to avoid a similar fate, the CCP has no choice but to open up, which in turn empowers other social classes that must be kept in check lest they overturn the system. ""As long as the CCP is able to reproduce itself as an organizational emperor,"" Zheng concludes, ""it is unlikely that China will develop into a Western style of democracy.""These two works come highly recommended. McGregor's is easily devoured in a few sessions, while Zheng's prose, heavy in political jargon and at times repetitive, undermines the book's readability, and as a result its contribution to our understanding of the CCP is unlikely to reach a mass audience.For all his nuanced perspective on the Chinese political system, Zheng also makes an incomprehensible slip toward the end, claiming, after indirectly laudatory passages about the emergence of democracy in Taiwan, that democratization characterized by the emergence of a multiparty system in Taiwan has not enabled the country to improve living standards as effectively as China, and led to corruption, ""social decay"" and ""economic chaos."" Coming as it does in the conclusion of his book, this hyperbolic remark hints at a bias against democracy that raises all kinds of unanswered questions about the book's premise.(Originally published in the Taipei Times, Nov. 7, 2010, p. 14.)","10 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB083ZLHL6T%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhE%252FlBtTlTkrIaZYTHut9TaCL%252B9mPWisRltYq3nxsWx5SAAAAAGQvy54AAAAB%26reviewId%3DR1R9UIEWVT3W3Z&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hE%2FlBtTlTkrIaZYTHut9TaCL%2B9mPWisRltYq3nxsWx5SAAAAAGQvy54AAAAB&reviewId=R1R9UIEWVT3W3Z","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
"Nicholas Nahat","4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","""Party on, Garth.  er.  Mao.""","2010年8月9日 在美国审核","","I felt as if I was perusing a high-level briefing on the contemporary state of politics in China while reading this book.  The Party demystifies the operations and attitudes of the current Communist Party on a range of the most politically salient areas, including business, the army, the state, and history.  In each chapter, the CCP is shown to be generally adaptive and creative in responding to social stresses, for example by refining its techniques of social control through banishing malcontents to the hinterlands (such as He Weifang, a law professor at elite Peking University, who was exiled from his prestigious post to a small college in far western Xinjiang), and avoiding terror only in the most extreme cases.  The general topics include a number of artfully chose case studies which diligently illustrate the author's theses about the CCP's involvement, attitude, and adaption at all levels of society.  Interesting and helpful analogies are made to various similar institutions in western societies, mainly the UK and the US, such as the tendency of key corporate executives to circulate in government or as advisors in law firms, and help regulate the very industries from which they emerge.  In addition, specific topics only glossed over generally in the press in recent years--SARS, the Sanlu poisoned milk scandal, the bid by CNOOC for Unocal--receive detailed treatment and situates these discrete events in a larger context.Still, one difficulty of the book is a limitation of journalism.  The CCP is not a monolithic, autonomous institution, but one rather situated in history and culture.  At some points, the CCP's anxieties are gestured at, for example, the author speculates that Hu Jintao is probably more concerned with a riot in Yunnan than the goings-on in the U.S. Senate.  A reason this is the case is that there is a theme of centripetal control by the center, as well as centrifugal forces diffusing power to the provinces.  This is hinted at, but could be more explicit--on the other hand, another 'theme' of Chinese history--that of foreign invasion--is well illustrated in a number of cases which animate the Party's concern, for example in periodic Japan-bashing.  This is not a great problem, but demonstrates the limits of a journalist in relating events which might be best understood with the broader brush of the historian.  The author also cannot escape his own biases in presenting an unflattering portrait of Mao and capping the book with a suggestive chapter entitled 'Tombstone,' even as he points out that China will likely continue to pursue its own course, and, indeed, inspire the world, independent of western modes of critique.  The author is very forthright in exposing his own prediction that the Party would collapse with the 'freedom' of capitalism, which has so far been frustrated.  Finally, this is such a vast subject that the book feels more like an executive summary, and could have been fleshed out with much more detail, but of course readability would have suffered as a result.On the whole, the Party is a supple and wise balance sheet of contemporary Chinese politics understood through the keen antennae of a Financial Times journalist, attuned to nuance, and always ready with a telling anecdote.  I recommend it not only as a study of the modern CCP, but also as a model of how books of this type should be written which embrace similar subjects.","3 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB083ZLHL6T%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhAvawgp6gnsjYHuQu50tRl5xSBjtUGvVhiFIY0q%252BQb8iAAAAAGQvy54AAAAB%26reviewId%3DR2TS2EGN22NPPN&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hAvawgp6gnsjYHuQu50tRl5xSBjtUGvVhiFIY0q%2BQb8iAAAAAGQvy54AAAAB&reviewId=R2TS2EGN22NPPN","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
"B. McEwan","4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","How did they do that?","2012年9月8日 在美国审核","","I grew up with the specter of ""Red China"" and all of the 1960s fear and sensationalism that went along with any discussion of communism. Then, as I grew older and more sophisticated (as did the world in general), and after I spent a summer in Hong Kong and had a chance to become acquainted with some mainland Chinese, I began to see that today's China is much more complex than many of us realize. Certainly the People's Republic deserves criticism for its dismal human rights record and its lack of personal freedoms. But you've got to hand it to a government that can lead a nation of 1 billion from Third World poverty to the world's second largest economy in 40 years. The question that kept nagging at me as I read and learned more about the PRC is, how exactly did they do that? Moreover, how do they continue to maintain control of all those people now that the population is mobile, has money and, courtesy of the internet, is able to access more information than ever before, the Great Firewall notwithstanding?The answer, according to this fascinating book, is by controlling personnel. The party weaves an iron bond between itself and the government by controlling all of the key government appointments in the nation. Through an entity called, innocuously, the Central Organization Department, the Communist Party of China is responsible for human resources. That may sound like mere bureaucracy, but in reality it means that the party penetrates every state body in the nation, along with a few private ones. As author Richard MacGregor explains, a comparable body in Washington, DC would appoint the entire federal cabinet, state governors and their deputies, mayors of all major cities, heads of all regulatory agencies, the justices of the Supreme Court and the heads of all major media organizations, such as The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post and heads of the TV, radio and cable networks. It would also control who was appointed to head ExxonMobil, Wal-Mart and other major corporations, as well as the presidents of big universities like Harvard and Yale and the heads of major foundations and think tanks, such as Heritage and Brookings. Plus, all of those appointments would be done in secret.Put in context like that, it is easy to see why the Chinese system is very, very dangerous, and why its principals -- a group of a dozen or so senior party officials -- are smart, powerful and very scary. And it certainly begs the question, at what price comes economic development?There is much more in this revealing, well-written book, but if this bit about the Central Organization department doesn't pique your interest, nothing will. I highly recommend The Party to anyone who wants to know more about China today, and what it is likely to look like tomorrow.","2 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB083ZLHL6T%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhKGVikH6IFte1owUvqBhjv50k1qCOZk3%252BLTxjD6%252FEo00AAAAAGQvy54AAAAB%26reviewId%3DR22N1XG3VD2ZKU&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hKGVikH6IFte1owUvqBhjv50k1qCOZk3%2BLTxjD6%2FEo00AAAAAGQvy54AAAAB&reviewId=R22N1XG3VD2ZKU","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
"Zai China","3.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","An overrated book that taks more about the relationship between the Party and Capitalism","2010年8月3日 在美国审核","","Read my whole critic here: [...]The book has been praised and well received by critics and audiences, who have placed it almost at the height of ""the definitive book about how the Party runs the country"". Maybe my expectations were too high, but the truth is that the book does not achieve such an ambitious goal. Richard McGregor certainly makes an interesting account of general aspects of the party organization and its power, but you always have the feeling that he could have dug further, that the real protagonists, the decision makers, are still in the shade. The author himself playes a lot with the idea of the Party as an invisible force, which ultimately can leave the reader the impression that ""yes, is very difficult to know how the party works, and you weren't able to find out neither after all"".I don't know if the title (The Party, The Secret World of China's Communist Rulers) was chosen by McGregor or by the publishing house, but the truth is that it seems much more a marketing technique than a description of its content. Actually, there are no big leaders talking in the book, it doesn't explain how the laws are passed in the country, it doesn't speak about the Communist Youth (an important Party organization that seems to be growing in influence) and there is a lack of many other key issues (it would have been interesting to talk about the politicians in the government that are not party members, like Chen Zhu).The book, however, is a very interesting description of the relationship between the Party and business. Here you can see some of the most important CEO of the country, the books examines who pulls the strings within each company and the symbiosis that's going on between the Party and entrepreneurs. The description of the corruption case of Chen Liangyu, the former party secretary of Shanghai, is a fascinating glimpse of the abuses of power in contemporary China and the internal disputes within the government. Special mention also for the case of milk contaminated with melamine after the Beijing Olympics, explained from the point of view of the company, the media and the government in a way that makes you see how the system failures can be lethal for its citizens.As a former Financial Times reporter, McGregor has used all his contacts he has developed over last  years in China, and the result is an interesting book where the economy is the protagonist. Two of the eight chapters are clearly about this (""China Inc.: The Party and Business"" and ""Deng Perfects Socialism: the Party and Capitalism""), but others chapters like the one about corruption, the personnel selection or ""the Party and the Regions"") tend to end up inevitably into the economic field. In this sense, the book can be fascinating for those (and there are many) who see China as an economic opportunity, are doing business in the country or are interested in the business world","34 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB083ZLHL6T%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhFoqa2kNZdGx1b6fAbiy8aBA8W2Vz2wrBDfLP6Q4aWUTAAAAAGQvy54AAAAB%26reviewId%3DR3R13UP1IA46J8&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hFoqa2kNZdGx1b6fAbiy8aBA8W2Vz2wrBDfLP6Q4aWUTAAAAAGQvy54AAAAB&reviewId=R3R13UP1IA46J8","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
"Peter Gregoire","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Thought-provoking and insightful - a must for any China watcher","2013年6月9日 在美国审核","","Richard McGregor's ""The Party"" offers us a well-balanced, thought-provoking insight into the machinations of the Chinese Communist Party and, more generally, into how China functions.Many Western commentators bray constantly about the imminent and inevitable collapse of the political system in China. According to them, the liberalization of the economic system and adoption of the free market, in which individual decisions about what to buy and what to sell hold sway, will inevitably undermine the autocracy of a political system where individual rights do not exist. In his masterful book, East & West, Chris Patten tells us that this contradiction cannot exist in the long-term. A breaking point is inevitable and when it comes, the Party will collapse.MacGregor, however, questions this premise. Plenty of predicted breaking points have presented themselves and yet the Party continues to hold the reins of power. If nothing else, this has demonstrated its astonishing adaptability. As such, those who say history ended when the Cold War was ""won"", with the defeat of a society based on a politically authoritarian and centralized economic model, by a politically democratic free-market society, may have rushed to judgement. For the resilience of the Communist Party in China, potentially offers a third-way of politically tight control coupled with relaxed control on economic matters. This was Deng Xiaoping's answer following events of June 1989. To this day, it continues.MacGregor further points out that rather than succumbing to the challenges of joining the WTO and the global financial crisis, some may say that the Deng's formula has seen China come off better than its Western counterparts. The ability of the Party, through the control it can still exert over the Chinese banks (which had been transformed from state owned monoliths into IPO'd companies whose shares were hoovered up) to quickly ensure money was pumped into the economy, stood in stark contrast to the US and Europe where quantitative easing was debated until the cows came home (and still is). The message from China's consequent economic uptick was: ""look how better we are than you are"". It also cemented the continued legitimacy of the Party.My particular favourite chapter in this book is that on the sinister, grey, anonymous and yet ultimately powerful, Central Organization Department, which MacGregor describes as the Party's HR department. The Organization Department, according to MacGregor, vets and controls an astonishing range of appointments so vital to the Party's continued exertion of power and control. I couldn't help but be amused and astonished by this description, as it seems to fit the way an HR department works in any large multinational company, albeit in ""China plc"" you can multiply the appointments it has to oversee by ten!Make no mistake, however. This book is certainly not an advert for China's system of government. MacGregor points out that corruption in China remains deep. The rights of those who question the system are ultimately suppressed if they cannot be shut up by co-option.  But what MacGregor's books gives us is a different insight to the Party, one which does not judge its ""goodness"" or ""badness"" but seeks to bring to our attention the fact that it has proven to be far more adaptable to meet the continuing challenges presented to its existence than we can imagine. Protests are met with the strategy of pay-off first, and only if that does not work, will they be stamped on. Propaganda, which failed in the SARs crisis, has since borrowed from the Blair government's handling of the mad-cow disease crisis to correct things.In its adaptability, the Party has so far found the key to its survival, and (through the continued deliverance of an economic miracle even in the midst of the financial crisis) its strengthening. It is, in short, not going anywhere. And as China continues its advance to world superpowerdom, we would all do well to take that lesson on board.Peter Gregoire - author of","1 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB083ZLHL6T%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhD95BKUIjkUSTgPcynMq7t1wjrxJNEVFm6X1FWl6dZzqAAAAAGQvy54AAAAB%26reviewId%3DRGGDMKT8QZ8PT&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hD95BKUIjkUSTgPcynMq7t1wjrxJNEVFm6X1FWl6dZzqAAAAAGQvy54AAAAB&reviewId=RGGDMKT8QZ8PT","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
"Michael Gordon","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","The Chinese Communist Party Can be Confusing to Understand ... Until you Read this Book","2019年1月15日 在美国审核","","For many foreigners, China's day to day decisions can be very confusing because there often isn't a clearly stated principle of why many of these decisions happen.  This book shows that the Communist Party in China is really very guarded about having any publicity over its actions.  The Chinese Communist Party does not have any markings noting the building where it is located. It does not have a web site, nor a social media presence, nor does it give a full list of all of its members.  The Party likes to be inside any large organization, private or public, to ensure that nothing happens  randomly that is outside of its control.  This is why there is actually a Communist Party group inside of large corporations, even western ones!, inside China.  Think of your large Western brand in China: many of these companies have pro-Communist Party propaganda in some fashion or another inside the company, and the company must pay for it.  The public image of government in China is overseen by the actual party.  Think of the judiciary.  They don't have any actual power.  The courts are not independent.  They literally just take on a role but the real power is in the hands of the Communist Party, which decides what should transpire.  Another issue is that the Chinese Communist Party is authoritarian, but it is not following the traditional ""communist"" vision of all the state owning all property.  Rather, the Communist Party in China is literally whatever the Communist Party wants it to mean.  If there is an advantage by taking on a particular policy, even if it contradicts the main tenets of communism, it doesn't matter, because communism means whatever the Communist Party wants it to mean.  That is why it will be a bit harder for the Communist Party to fail in China than it did in Russia.  It is mainly because it is a bit less doctrinaire and ideological than the Soviets were.","1 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB083ZLHL6T%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhBJLUGcBDzYZo19Gwx64AjO9y30jrTqFKHMfohNEZ22AAAAAAGQvy54AAAAB%26reviewId%3DR1P0TZB1Y9O1JT&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hBJLUGcBDzYZo19Gwx64AjO9y30jrTqFKHMfohNEZ22AAAAAAGQvy54AAAAB&reviewId=R1P0TZB1Y9O1JT","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
"Souvik Mitra","4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Good chronicle of the Chinese Communist party","2012年9月3日 在美国审核","","In Eight chapters, McGregor covers the themes that the Chinese Communist parties influences - these include the state, businesses, the personnel department, the military, matters of corruption, the span of central control, the marriage of capitalism & socialism, & finally the history of China.To be sure - these essays were written in pieces over a period of 8 years -  McGregor does a fairly good job of organizing this multifaceted & dynamic system into some sort of a coherence. This is particularly so because of the secrecy that this entire behemoth operates with. Having said that though, you'll find that most of these things intermingle all the time. The stories of corruption are also the stories of Chinese businesses as they are the stories of the propaganda department. The autonomy asserted by the regions are also stories of business & corruption. In fact, as I write this review, it appears to me that the the Chinese story, at least since the time that Deng took over & beyond, really is a story of two competing/cooperating/contradictory themes - one of control & the other of efficiency. It is the interplay of these two forces that determine what China does. Wherever this combination succeeds, as it has done in most cases, efficiency has produced the kind of growth that we've witnessed fueled by access to land, resources & licenses all controlled by the party.There are a quite a few interesting non-economic stories in many chapters. These touch on the political system within the party, the awkward balance between capitalistic & Marxist philosophies, the still awkward pseudo-reward system that corruption really constitutes & the the glaring gaps in Chinese official history of China.I'd have to say that I had to struggle a bit to get through this book, but that does not, by any means, reduce the value of its content. Much like the system this book looks to elucidate, this book itself, in spite of Mcgregor's best attempts, can seem dry & overly interconnected with more than necessary detail. Having said that, if you persist, I reckon you'll definitely learn new aspects or of new relationships, however contorted, that govern China.@souvikstweets","1 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB083ZLHL6T%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhBe%252F%252F55OzDFflEuh9w9Ln3%252F9YNpTkaiSy2WrfgtKuYY4AAAAAGQvy54AAAAB%26reviewId%3DR3DT20AIATZ14Q&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hBe%2F%2F55OzDFflEuh9w9Ln3%2F9YNpTkaiSy2WrfgtKuYY4AAAAAGQvy54AAAAB&reviewId=R3DT20AIATZ14Q","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
"Robert","3.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Interesting stories but not particularly cohesive","2011年1月4日 在美国审核","","I enjoyed reading this book.  I learned a lot about China and a lot about the impact of the Communist party since it took power in 1949 (?).  But I was ultimately unsatisfied for 2 reasons:One, it felt more like a collection of interesting stories and less like a coherent book.  The stories of particular episodes in China did not seem to follow any time line or any other organizational structure.  I struggled to understand how the stories related to each other or whatever connections were implied.  The stories seemed to jump between periods in China that didn't make any sense to me.  That said, each episode was interesting and educational.Two, I kept expecting for the author to explain to the reader why China is thriving.  He provides a wealth of details about how corrupt the system is from the highest levels in Beijing to the lowest levels in each town/province/whatever.  He details how ""the party"" influences almost every economic decision that gets made.  He makes various statements about how this or that leader opened up China to market reforms and private property rights but in the same breath details how government at every level influences decisions.  I walked away from this book still scratching my head as to how China has grown in the past 30-ish years.  I'm still trying to figure that out.Read this book for interesting insights into China over the past 60 years.  But don't expect to have any better understanding of the big picture.","38 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB083ZLHL6T%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhPcnoqThEemV0ruH6xWVaXp5sA%252F0YfST8%252F8S1txw7veOAAAAAGQvy54AAAAB%26reviewId%3DR1BQ3QU8BP1VCE&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hPcnoqThEemV0ruH6xWVaXp5sA%2F0YfST8%2F8S1txw7veOAAAAAGQvy54AAAAB&reviewId=R1BQ3QU8BP1VCE","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
"Anthony O'Brien","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","The , Chinese communism revealedParty","2010年7月28日 在美国审核","","Every now and again, a truly definitive book on China emerges. One such was ""Hungry Ghosts"", Jasper Becker's account of Mao's disastrous ""Great Leap Forward"". Another is ""The Dragon's Gift,"" Deborah Brautigam's definitive account of China's involvement in Africa. ""The Party"", Richard McGregor's investigation of the Chinese Communist Party(CCP), its structure, influence and power, is a truly authoritative work.McGregor's strength as an author is that ""The Party"" is not only informative, but also immensely readable. It is enlivened with anecdotes of particular case studies, cadres who have risen and fallen from grace, entrepreneurs who have carved out business empires only to fall foul of the authorities, and Party officials who have made fortunes from bribes, only to be executed as scape-goats for the Party's overall corruption. He reveals the sheer extent and pervasiveness of the Party's grip on China as no other book has yet done. And suddenly, so much of what emerges from China as distinctly alien politics makes perfect sense. The Party has the same hierarchical structure and power as the medieval Church of Rome. Indeed, the sale of Party official posts and favours resembles nothing so much as the sale of indulgences in pre-Reformation Europe. Simony, the buying or selling of ecclesiastical pardons, offices, or emoluments, is exactly paralleled by the sale of similar, secular perks in China by the CCP.A few quotations will give the spirit of the book, and a quick insight into the flavour of 21st. century Communism, Chinese-style.""The Party is like God. He is everywhere. You just can't see him."" [a professor at People's University in Beijing].""Listen, we are the Communist Party and we will define what communism is."" Chen Yuan, Governor of China Development Bank, in response to being hectored by a US political scientist about contradictions between Marxism and China's free market reforms.""...the only way to put the latest communist principles into practice was to maximise returns for shareholders."" Guo Shuqing, CEO of the China Construction Bank.McGregor draws on twenty years of reporting from China, and has done more than any other writer really to penetrate the veils of secrecy and paranoia surrounding China's ruling elite. He shows how a non-elected Standing Committee of just nine men ultimately control every aspect of Chinese political life.McGregor points out that one organisation alone, the Central Organization Department, the party's vast and opaque human resources agency, has extraordinary power by any standards. ""It has no public phone number, and there is no sign on the huge building it occupies near Tiananmen Square. Guardian of the party's personnel files, the department handles key personnel decisions not only in the government bureaucracy but also in business, media, the judiciary and even academia. Its deliberations are all secret.""If such a body existed in the United States, McGregor writes, it `would oversee the appointment of the entire US cabinet, state governors and their deputies, the mayors of major cities, the heads of all federal regulatory agencies, the chief executives of GE, Exxon-Mobil, Wal-Mart and about fifty of the remaining largest US companies, the justices of the Supreme Court, the editors of the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post, the bosses of the TV networks and cable stations, the presidents of Yale and Harvard and other big universities, and the heads of think-tanks like the Brookings Institution and the Heritage Foundation.'""Chairman Mao said that the State stands on three legs, the Military, the Economy, and the Media. The CCP has complete control of all three.Richard McGregor has written a stunning, engrossing, fascinating book. Don't miss it. China controls an ever-expanding slice of the world. This book shows whose hands are on the levers.","5 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB083ZLHL6T%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhJHSNJ0QbTpgd55UuncsDnyV4TdZhAGTzTmb2vG1MNWhAAAAAGQvy54AAAAB%26reviewId%3DRQG2PVN6WPO35&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hJHSNJ0QbTpgd55UuncsDnyV4TdZhAGTzTmb2vG1MNWhAAAAAGQvy54AAAAB&reviewId=RQG2PVN6WPO35","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
"NJ","3.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Read for a different sort of lessons","2021年7月22日 在美国审核","","Reading The Party about a decade since its publication throws good light on issues raised by perennial China skeptics. The book is informative in its details on CCP's hold over life and everything else in China. Its absolutism is laudatory at a level, even though most readers will wonder if the author - and similar commentators - would apply the same brush to nations and governments strategically more important to their host nations.The main conclusions are elsewhere. There is no dearth of experts uneasy with the Chinese ways ever since its growth started drawing their attention, particularly from the Tiananmen protests. Almost all have forecasted an imminent political and economic collapse stressing the unsustainability of the Chinese ways while excessively drawing on the mistakes of the Mao times.China will have ups and downs in the years ahead. The downcycles will be different from those elsewhere, even if equally or more/less painful, characterized by the Party's unique structure. And yet, three things are lost in the analysis of the kind presented in the book.One, every system in the world is unique and causes its community to go through its distinctive cycles. This is not to say some systems are not more wrong, but a perspective on any success matter to analyze any predicted doom. None of the forecasted collapses of China have come to a pass so far. Books of the kind must discuss what has allowed the party to go on so long before turning to incremental changes that could lead to a complete collapse from now.Two, Xi Jinping's era further solidifies that the Party continues to shift. This is not a hindsight analysis, but even when the book was written, it was clear that the 2010 CCP was utterly different from the one in 1995, 1979, or 1965, as it is now from 2010. It is important to recount events and disasters of the previous fifty years but the author - and many others - excessively use them to give their interpretations of reality now.Three, some things on human rights and individual freedoms are wrong absolutely. End results in economic or political successes should not be used to either justify them or predictions of failures to announce their futility. Champions of such causes, however, always bear the burden of proving their credentials that they are not prejudiced. The book fails to establish this.In conclusion, the book is a helpful read to understand the pitfalls of standard China analysis we see in abundance these days.","1 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB083ZLHL6T%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhNkUk6PDT4dGF2CTFtGedyOALdfEfRyrUNbUX5hJTQYeAAAAAGQvy6AAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR1V65FIEX7EJ7I&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hNkUk6PDT4dGF2CTFtGedyOALdfEfRyrUNbUX5hJTQYeAAAAAGQvy6AAAAAB&reviewId=R1V65FIEX7EJ7I","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

With the collapse of the Soviet Union, there is much less understanding out there at how ""the Party"" and the government are separate entities in a communist system and who does what in society, and this is tailored to show how the system evolved distinctly in China. There are however more current books out there that may be better suited to the specialist looking for what's changing today in China.

"Maynard Handley","2.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Very disappointing","2010年12月3日 在美国审核","","The most important thing to appreciate about this book is that it is written by a journalist, not an academic, and as such it it riddled with the mindlessness and sensationalization one expects from journalists.I don't want to say that the author has an explicit agenda against China and the party; an agenda would be the product of definite thought. Rather, the author is so thoroughly steeped in the idea that there is one and only one true way to run a country that he simply cannot wrap his head around the concept that in other places, things are done differently. So instead of actual explanations of how the society functions, we are treated to a constant stream of amazement at the ways of those weird foreigners. Pointing out that things are different is fine for the first two pages, after that having the point re-iterated every third sentence becomes tiresome --- there is a reason Bruce McCall's ""In the New Canada, Living is a Way of Life"" is parody.There is, moreover, more (or less) to this style of writing than simply that it is grating --- it reveals that the analysis of the book is intensely problematic. There is, sadly, far too little comparison with the way other societies, both today and in the past, have been governed; for example in the behavior and organizations described, I saw glimpses of Tudor England. A similar problem is that all too-often the party is treated as a monolithic borg. But the Party consists of around 80 million people --- around a quarter of the population of the US. No group of people of that size is monolithic; on the other hand plenty of large organizations (think large corporations) do a reasonably good of projecting a monolithic image. A better analysis would have put this fact front and center. A third complaint along these lines is the constant reiteration of the word ""communist"" as some sort of boogieman. The author seems to want to use the term as a cudgel for switching off debate --- he doesn't, and you the reader don't, have to consider the larger ethical picture here of how the society works because we all know the connotations of the word communist --- and if they are secret communists, well that's that much more nefarious.It seems that few of the other Amazon reviewers agree with my take on this book, but the point is that I was hoping for something at least marginally academic, investigating how such a large organization truly functions and imposes its will; and was very disappointed to have the book be so journalistic.","34 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB083ZLHL6T%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhO8Xd9gdw3FdNz%252Be8RCZUGP9xX6kl9rUkRKIJww7hn7UAAAAAGQvy6AAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR4SFHOWB9PN8Q&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hO8Xd9gdw3FdNz%2Be8RCZUGP9xX6kl9rUkRKIJww7hn7UAAAAAGQvy6AAAAAB&reviewId=R4SFHOWB9PN8Q","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

Financial Times correspondent Richard McGregor explains why and more. He unveils the secrets of one of the most mysterious organizations in the world: the Chinese Communist Party. If you think a communist organization controlling a major global economy is counterintuitive, you're probably right. But McGregor explains how it all happened - and the roles that various entities such as business, the Chinese military, and the nation's regions and cities continue to play. Understanding how an anticapitalist, communist country became one of the world's economic powerhouses means dealing with a cast of thousands and a dizzying array of names and roles.

"Charles Bookman","4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","How does China's Free Market Economics Square with its Communist Ideology?","2016年1月23日 在美国审核","","China’s sustained double-digit growth is one of the great economic success stories of our time. How did China, with its professed Communist ideology and revolutionary history, accomplish such a feat? How do ordinary Chinese as well as their leaders square free-wheeling, free-market success with the collectivist and egalitarian ideals of the Communist movement? In “The Party”, Richard McGregor draws on nearly a decade of business and political reporting in China to find out how the system accommodates a market economy within the big tent of communist ideals. He explains how the system works. “The Party” is an important text for those who seek to understand modern China.

"Loyd Eskildson","4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Informative -","2010年7月9日 在美国审核","","McGregor's ""The Party"" provides important insight into how China operates. Membership in the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) exceeds 73 million (about 12% of adults), and controls every level of government, as well as official religions, the media, large, state-owned businesses, and the various other allowed political parties. Ironically, the CCP came into power as a result of popular abhorrence of corruption, and it is now likewise riddled itself. Its foundation has move from preaching equality to allowing incomes as unequal as anywhere in Asia, and from despising to enabling business leaders. Nonetheless, the World Bank credits China with lowering the number of its poor by one-half billion from 1981 to 2004. Star students and wealthy entrepreneurs are sought out for CCP membership.Public institution officials receive periodic training from a network of 2,800 schools before becoming eligible for promotion; accusations of criminal conduct are first investigated by the Party, and it decides whether to take action. Leaders and budgets of the 8 approved 'democratic parties' are set by the CCP. Things that formerly required Party approval (where one lives, works, studies, marries) have largely become acts of choice in urban areas, less so in rural zones.Corruption is a major problem, especially in Shanghai, possibly because it has become a socialism showcase. Positions in customs, taxation, land sales, infrastructure development, procurement, and regulation are especially vulnerable.","3 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB083ZLHL6T%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhFsWVIOpTUE65EBlPM5ypTKtZeyFyncPHHz4cFQz2x9%252BAAAAAGQvy6AAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR30O84SVIF5KWD&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hFsWVIOpTUE65EBlPM5ypTKtZeyFyncPHHz4cFQz2x9%2BAAAAAGQvy6AAAAAB&reviewId=R30O84SVIF5KWD","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
"Samuel J. Sharp","4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Many Small Stories Inside an Informative Book","2012年10月9日 在美国审核","","This is a very informative and thorough look at modern China and the dominant role played by the Communist party in China's political and business activities. McGregor paints the picture of a party obsessed with control and information by telling many individual stories based on interviews he conducted. This means that some chapters are more interesting than others in part because of the individuals McGregor could locate for interviews. Chapters 2 and 7 which focus on Chinese enterprise were particularly interesting whereas chapter 3 on party personnel was a slog. McGregor is a serious journalist who provides lots of information without injecting his personal views.  Thus ""The Party"" is not one the many recent books on China that are intended to scare or enrage rather than inform readers.The reliance on interviews does make for a book that feels ""zoomed in"" on particular people and issues, rather than a comprehensive and broad look at China and the party as a whole. Nonetheless, this is still a very clear window into how China works and I recommend it alongside other books like ""Capitalism Without Democracy"" and ""The Beijing Consensus"" that are equally helpful in understanding modern China.","1 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB083ZLHL6T%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhGytwjEm%252FfjzNgyWiKEeT5ksurUQ1P0%252BTgCaxMp07nnMAAAAAGQvy6AAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR3MQV9M10LFBHX&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hGytwjEm%2FfjzNgyWiKEeT5ksurUQ1P0%2BTgCaxMp07nnMAAAAAGQvy6AAAAAB&reviewId=R3MQV9M10LFBHX","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
"Rajiv Thind","3.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Yellow Journalism about Red China","2013年6月8日 在美国审核","","***3 Stars*** or B-This book is rich in information. However, I think what ruins this book is its alarmist tone. One may as well assume--as millions of Chinese certainly will--that the book was written with secret funding from  major Western governments' foreign policy departments to undermine the Chinese economic miracle. Author seems extremely exasperated that despite its ""Leninist"" and ""Soviet"" style political system China has reaped the rewards of free market economics.The author repeatedly charges that The Communist Party is controlled by an ""Elite"". Which country, community, society or political system does not have an elite of one sort or another? Even your run-off-the-mill Conspiracy Theorist can talk to you for hours about the Bilderberg Group, Catholic Church, Bohemian Grove, Rothchilds and so on....I'm sure millions of Chinese who have been lifted out of debilitating and soul-destroying poverty, lack and hunger are nothing but thankful to The Party. Okay, China did it without embracing Liberal democracy, and some concerns about China's rising military expenditure (and its aggressive territorial claims) may be justified. But there is no reason to demonize almost every aspect of the recent Chinese reforms and economic success led by The Party.Also, in the third chapter (with a cheesy title of ""Keepers of the File"") the author presents Chinese Central Organization Department as some kind of all-seeing sinister mammoth that has no counterpart in any Western country. But such amorphous central government bodies can be traced in many so called democracies; some would name the United States Department of Homeland Security as a worthy candidate. Although, I suppose, it is the job of governments to keep an eye on domestic activities in order to maintain peace and order. This overseeing role does not always have to have sinister goals.I would see the modern Chinese Communist Party as a strict and stern parent, who refuses to give his/her children the freedom to be frolicsome because the times are tough and full of huge challenges. But eventually, it all works out when the children with such upbringing end up becoming successful and responsible adults.As for ""Democracy"", I personally think, with time, China will afford its citizens more political freedoms. Take South Korea as a model for China. When, after the Second World War, South Korea embraced economic liberalism its government retained many dictatorial elements. But after a few decades South Korea embraced political liberalism as well, and now it is a robust liberal democracy. China too will get there, by and by.Lastly, as the author himself admits, it took the Western Industrial Revolution at least a hundred years to achieve the same level of progress and development that the Chinese Industrial Revolution has achieved in only three decades. So, instead of being jealous, paranoid and insecure, let's applaud and be inspired by the Chinese success in making life better for millions of men, women and children of the human race.","9 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB083ZLHL6T%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhH9BRuog1V2Rvjyx%252FDjCjvLiN9nCtODGMu0qjJI514l5AAAAAGQvy6AAAAAB%26reviewId%3DRBTC7A88XN9E&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hH9BRuog1V2Rvjyx%2FDjCjvLiN9nCtODGMu0qjJI514l5AAAAAGQvy6AAAAAB&reviewId=RBTC7A88XN9E","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
"Diz","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Decay and Evolution","2011年3月25日 在美国审核","","This is a really fascinating account of the current state of China and the Chinese Communist Party. Too often, accounts of China in the West take a surface view of this burgeoning economy and assume that development must, in many ways, rely on the economic, if not social, models of the West, particularly after the demise of Russian communism. This relatively short book paints a far more subtle, nuanced and inclusive picture of a country and it's ruling party as both 'decaying and evolving' in the face of internal and external challenges.In eight clearly defined chapters, McGregor considers 'The Party and the State', 'The Party and Business', 'The Party and Personnel', 'The Party and the Gun', 'The Party and Corruption', 'The Party and the Regions', 'The Party and Capitalism' and 'The Party and History'. What comes across is a picture of a ruling central organisation that is ubiquitous, fragile, subtle and, at the same time, hugely adaptable. The Party is not synonymous with the government, nor the state. 'The Party', as the quote at the beginning of Chapter 1 says 'is like God. He is everywhere. You just can't see him'. It has survived horrendous famines, the Cultural Revolution, Tienanmen Square and, so far, many of the vicissitudes assailing Western economies. How it has managed this, and how it may continue to do so for some time to come, is laid out in each chapter as Mr McGregor takes a core element of Chinese society and investigates it's relationship to the Party, using an illuminating mixture of history, example and anecdote.Many western investors in Chinese businesses assume that China is, in some sense, becoming a capitalist society, but this is to completely miss the intimate relationship between the Party and all levels of the economy. It is assumed that China's state-run sector will suffer the same fate as such enterprises in Russia, but this is to miss both the flexibility of the organisation and the readiness to learn from the mistakes of others. It is far from perfect, of course, but it is more open to change, as long as this change is supervised and sanctioned by the Party, than many Western commentators realise.Overall, what comes across is both, in some ways, rather admirable and Orwellian. But the point is continually made that anyone who thinks that China is simply adopting a Western 'free market' strategy is seriously mistaken - the role and actions of the Party remain central. Again, the Party can both 'decay and evolve'.","4 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB083ZLHL6T%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhHF4IPL2Y8qOQLsmkglWxBDhPdazFA7b%252Fb7aU5iMVkE5AAAAAGQvy6AAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR10B6FCYXCRPY3&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hHF4IPL2Y8qOQLsmkglWxBDhPdazFA7b%2Fb7aU5iMVkE5AAAAAGQvy6AAAAAB&reviewId=R10B6FCYXCRPY3","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
"hjon203","1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","ideology and the reality","2011年1月26日 在美国审核","","this book is based on total hypes. It's sad that so many people nowadays try to change this  nation into communist or socialism ( same role, just different name) not really knowing the truth, just based on some political ideology that human history had repeatedly  proved to be failed.  In fact communism is the worst political system that ever presented on earth.1989, Tinamen square, a million chines college students marched to protest against their communist government of oppression: it was broadcasted all over the world, they were asking communist government to give them ;freedom for speech, media, business, religion, true-democracy( not like few communist party people controlling) by election. Sooner the communist government sent them tanks and guns and indiscriminately shoot them and ran over with tank. Whole world watched through television broadcast.Now some ignorant Americans already forgot about this just 20 years ago's brutality that we watched with our own eyes, want to change this great nation into communist?Because of its brutality, I escaped from that regime. And I  am happy to be in this country where human freedom is mostly respected, and protected. Communist lies saying every one shares equally: In fact only, those few comrades who caused the shift of power enjoy the wealth and power, but the rest of the general citizens have no equality nor basic human right. Any one speak against government---disappear next day to ""concentration camp"" w/o fair trials nor justice. Communist shut down all religious freedom, or freedom of speech ( all medias are government controlled) Communists deny any form of gods but instead, they set the status of Stalin or Ma chiding, or Kimjung ill, and have to sing songs and salute for them, worship them.  From elementary children to elders... Anyone dares to go against the government, ---labor camp!  Several millions who stand  for their freedom were killed brutally  in early 20th century, during the communism overturn. ,Research the communism nations' history. All the nations turned into  communism fall into worst human rights and economic state from their establishment. Any communist countries in the history ever get better as decades go by?China is the only seemingly doing well now. Why? because from 10 years ago, they realized communism was failed with extreme poverty, started to adapting the partial capitalism into their system-free competitive capitalism. That's the reality people. Stalin communist government killed 90 millions including the vicinity nations that were turn into communism, Macho-tong communist killed 100 millions, 2 millions by North Korea, by Cambodia each, 2 millions in Africa, 200,000 latin America..so on . But most of all they all became terribly poor after communist regime,oppressing the free capitalism, except China, because they started to adapt the partial capitalism from 10 years ago after they realized the harsh economic state. Now history tells also other evil regime; Hitler killed 6 million jew with other 4 million of Europeans; Japan' imperialism killed 20 million Asians during WWII, ..so on.Men can't govern themselves. They always proved to be failed again and again throughout the history. If USA turned into communism, the power will shift  to only those who hate the existing American system. They  secretly controlling communicast-medias ( I already see it happened ) and brainwashing the youth with distorted  facts in textbooks  last 20 years. They keep change their names, their activity, and theory. Why? if they openly speak up, they know they will fail because any normal mind people will see the deception and its perversion. Look at these behind scene head members:They are  mostly angry people with extreme hatred. Before you get associate with these kinds, study the actual communism history and the result of those countries over last 100 years.  then you might understand why people escape from those communist countries despite the danger of their lives, come to USA.  Americans seem so ignorant ,  don't even  know what kind of freedom or dreams that anyone can pursue if they want. I can't believe how americans are lazy and stupid (sorry for my expression) not protecting their precious freedom and the wealth that whole world envy. Pretty sad to see this great nation is stumbling by the smooth, deceitful talking,  present government and together with mostly blinded, deceivedmajority. My last word: America wake up and protect what your forefathers gave to you. Don't get robbed by those haters of your wealth and power. If America had been  the most wealthy and liberal nation in the whole world so far, doesn't it already proved what you have is the best national  system already?Do you have to be a rocket scientist to see this simple truth?

"Hugh Claffey","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","A  must read.","2014年7月30日 在美国审核","","The leit-motif of this book is the ‘red-phone’ on the desks of senior executives in Chinese companies. The idea is that the communist party maintains control of major ‘private’ coporations.  He shows that the three main telecommunications companies, in theory in competition, swopped chief executives at the behest of the party.  McGregor gives us a tour of various parts of Chinese society – industry, the army, the civil service, among others.  He notes the significant part that corruption plays in the party, and the fact that the party;s insistence that there is no other power structure can exist in China, means that the corruption, which is associated with power, cannot be effectively eliminated.  In fact, the waves of investigations of corruption have been used by powerful factions within the party to root out their rivals.My reaction to the book was that a lot of what Is being described is Economic Nationalism – take an example of France – where the government directs a lot of what industrial leaders do, and industrial leaders cycle in and out of government departments.  As I finished the book, it seemed to me that the lack of effective, independent power structures within the society and the regularity and possibility of changing the party in government is what distinguishes Chinese society from Western ones.

"M. Laine","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","excellent; critical but balanced look into China's politics","2012年5月27日 在美国审核","","I got a signed copy of the recent (2010) book by Richard McGregor as a present. The Party: The Secret World of China's Communist Rulers is a serious piece of work. Mr. McGregor, the former China bureau chief of Financial Times, has written a disturbing portrait of one of the most powerful and secretive forces on the planet today and written it well.In his position, the author had access to people inside the system few westerners have had the opportunity to meet. I assume being the chief of FT in China opened doors to Mr. McGregor that stay closed to most academics. In any case the author has had the chance to interview some pretty interesting individuals from different sides of Chinese society, including government heavyweights, businessmen and political dissidents. From the pumpkin seed producer drying his hard earned, but moldy cash out in the open for all to see, to city mayors, all explain their position in China today.McGregor's writing is easy to follow and I especially appreciate the fairness seldom encountered in contemporary western books about the Party, or Chinese society in general. The author pulls no punches when he exposes the corruption and the, to western eyes incomprehensible, system of favours and nepotism prevalent in China, but he also gives credit where credit is due. This book is not about bashing the Chinese system or the Party; it's a book that really digs deep into behind-the-scenes politics, without gloating at the failures of the system.I have not come across a book giving such a detailed account of the inner workings of the CPC before.

The country is ruled by the party bosses from Beijing, who are not elected by the people, but from within their own ranks. Their dictates which can change at any time are the law. The officials at the county levels control what goes on in their provinces. This self policing, plus low wages inevitably leads to corruption. Also the Chinese people in each province want to outdo the other provinces as far as production and GDP are concerned, which leads to environmental pollution and quality control issues. Remember the Chinese pet food that killed so many American animals? Businesses walk a fine line. They can not do or say anything that would shed a negative light on the Communist party.

The only thing really required is to comment on whether it is good or not, and, as it happens, it is quite good.

Mr. McGregor is a journalist and his investigative skills, analysis, and objectivity really shine. The Party would be good for China-book completists or newbies.

"l henry","3.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","A bit long but very revealing","2011年1月17日 在美国审核","","Although some of the chapters were too long and could have been sub headed or split overall I found the book very revealing. Revealing not only about China but the West as well.The Great Leap Forward, The Cultural Revolution, Tianamen Square, the list goes on and on. For none of these atrocities has China been made to pay any price. As long as China will contibute to our politicians campaigns, finance our debt and satisfy our need for cheap consumer items readily availble at the neighborhood ""mart"" what do we care what the PRC does, or did to it's own people, the vast majority of which will never see a dime of the riches reaching Beijing, Shanghai, or Hong Kong.My late father always claimed that WWW III could well be the U.S. and Russia versus China. That military scenario may never occur, but I would venture that we are at war with China already, we are just too busy spending our selves to defeat to know we are fighting it. We ignore Mao at our peril, he once told Russia ""...kill milions of us, there will be millions more waiting behind every tree when you invade..."" Those words now are ""spend your dollars with us, we have billions of yuans with which to buy you.""","4 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB083ZLHL6T%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhF48Co7%252FWF1JkkNWtzkATg4ID2f2eVMua9p7kBLvB7D5AAAAAGQvy6IAAAAB%26reviewId%3DRBNCSCQL5GFH2&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hF48Co7%2FWF1JkkNWtzkATg4ID2f2eVMua9p7kBLvB7D5AAAAAGQvy6IAAAAB&reviewId=RBNCSCQL5GFH2","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

"OnChina@Tumblr","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Practically Flawless","2013年6月26日 在美国审核","","For the first-time visitor and the frequent traveller to China, the inner workings of the Chinese Communist Party are far from transparent and often overlooked in expeditious pursuit of the travel destination or business deal.  For those of us resident in China, the Chinese government, or ""the Party"", is a behind-the-scenes, all-pervasive enigma few of us understand given the paucity of information emanating from the Party itself.The Party: The Secret World of China's Communist Rulers is a well-intentioned attempt to go beyond the whisperings of our Chinese colleagues.  As the former China bureau chief of the Financial Times, Mr. McGregor had more access than most to the deeply secretive Chinese government.  He uses this access skillfully to access the force behind China's economic transformation, and attempts to answer the question many of us politely decline to ask our Chinese colleagues: ""If the Party, locked in its ossified Leninist ways, is secretive, corrupt, hostile to the rule of law and vindictive in the pursuit of enemies...how on earth did it manage to preside over one of the greatest spurts of economic growth and wealth creation in recorded history"".  In a time when the ""Beijing Consensus"" of authoritarian socialism is being seriously considered as an alternative to the ""Washington Consensus"", the book certainly hits upon a timely issue.  Unfortunately, while the book is important to the China neophyte and a healthy reminder to the rest of us, our appetite for the Party's secrets are left largely unsated.In the first chapter, ""The Red Machine: The Party and the State,"" McGregor sets the tone in this atheist nation with a quotation by an unnamed university professor, ""The party is like God. He is everywhere. You just can't see him."".  He goes on to draw parallels between the big red machine of the Party and the use of telephone hotline ""red machines"" outfitted in each of the top 50 state-owned enterprises, the offices of the top newspaper editors and some 300 other offices, to show the interconnectedness of the Party.McGregor, an Australian, is at his best when drawing striking comparisons between China and the U.S., belittling the myth of China as all-embracing of Western capitalism.  He points out that here in the Shanghai, the showcase of Western-style capitalism and often compared to New York, state-owned enterprises produce 80 percent of the GDP.  Although the figure he uses is somewhat higher than the 48 percent put forth by a recent joint study by the Shanghai Enterprise Confederation and the Shanghai Entrepreneurs' Association, his point is valid for the whole of China, especially in the second- and third-tier cities.  His best comparison occurs in early 2009, when the heads of the top three telecom firms are reshuffled in an effort to reduce cronyism and corruption - an action equivalent to the heads of AT&T, Verizon and Sprint in the U.S. being shuffled without notice.In the third chapter, ""The Keeper of the Files"", McGregor fascinates us with the inner workings of the Central Organization Department, the Party's human resources department with ""all the trappings of a sophisticated, multi-national headhunter"" with rules and regulations.  Lest we get too impressed, he adds that ""the same regulations contain loopholes large enough to push the numerical benchmarks aside"", loopholes presumably driven by cronyism, corruption, and other Chinese characteristics.In the fifth chapter ""The Shanghai Gang"", the author provides a fascinating account of how graft corrupts the capitalist workings of the real estate industry.  Given the vast amount of corruption, McGregor sees China as ""more of a political miracle, albeit one built on economic growth"".In the final chapter ""Tombstone"", McGregor details the epic work of Yang Jisheng, who after two decades of painstaking research compiled the two-volume book Tombstone, chronicling the death by starvation of 35 to 40 million Chinese during the Great Leap Forward.  While the book sold well in Hong Kong it was naturally banned on the mainland, presumably by the Central Propaganda Department, in charge of the media and the enforcer of history.  While the Department's role is quite far-reaching and controlling, McGregor overdramatises the Department's role in enforcing the official line, stating that ""Nothing less than national security is at stake"".  While the Central Propaganda Department may believe this to be true, and in may be true in dealing with the outbreaks of violence in Xinjiang and Tibet, for the most part the Department tales it self too seriously.  In the context of today's China, where collective historical amnesia reigns and people are obsessed with obtaining and preserving wealth, a ""coming out"" of the atrocities during the Great Leap Forward would not necessarily plunge the nation into instability and devour the Party.  The majority of Chinese today are far too busy trading up their salaries in new jobs every six months in order to save for a downpayment or meet a mortgage payment on that apartment or house their future wife is demanding.McGregor saves the best for last in his Afterword, where he rebuts scenarios in which the Party loses power.  The current financial crisis is quickly dismissed, as many of the toxic instruments had yet to be sold to or developed within an immune China.  McGregor chooses to overlook his earlier comment on the 1997 Asian financial meltdown in which ""for the whole banking system, 45 percent of loans made before 2000 had gone bad"".  One wonders what is different this time around following China's recent massive stimulus lending to real estate and infrastructure.  The inclusion of China in the World Trade Organisation was expected by many to expose China's weakness when in fact its trade surpluses have grown since joining.  The rise of the middle class, where many a revolution has been launched, has also failed to topple the Party, as owners of apartments and shares turn more conservative in hopes of preserving their wealth.  The much-touted (and growing) Gini coefficient, a measure of inequality, has not weakened the people's faith in getting rich first, and corruption charges are merely the outcome of a political struggle.  Indeed, corruption is a major concern for the Party as of late, with internet users increasingly active in drawing out the most flagrant abuses that embarass the system.  The number of high-profile cases seems to be growing, maybe because of greater disclosure.  Yet in a country as large as China with a huge state sector, the number of Party officials being disciplined remains small - since 1982, of the 130,000 to 190,000 officials disciplined annually for malfeasance, only 6 percent were criminally prosecuted with only 3 percent going to jail and 80 percent receiving a mere warning.  Growing public discontent over the lack of action taken on corrupt officials may be behind recent protests.  Official data show a more than tenfold increase in the annual number of large protests and disturbances since 1993, with more than 90,000 cases reported in each of the past four years.  For it seems that as long as the abuses are not too excessive, and whilst you can pay protesters to get off the street, the corruption will continue.  And as McGregor rightly points out, some corrupt regimes have enormous staying power.On the whole his work provides a mere glimpse into the otherwise opaque machinations of the Chinese Communist Party.  McGregor readily admits in a recent interview of having ""barely scratched the surface"", and the reader is inevitably left asking for more.  And many of us wonder what the big fuss is about - why is this book banned in China and pressure put upon the American Chamber of Commerce in Beijing to cancel a planned speech by the author?.  Nonetheless, his work is mandatory reading among the expatriate community in China and for foreigners wishing for a peek inside the decision-making apparatus of the Chinese Communist Party.What worries me most after reading this book is how much further the Party, and its ruling officials, can take China.  Case in point is Vice-President Xi Jinping, newly appointed vice-chairman of China's Central Military Commission, widely expected to assume leadership of the Party when Hu Jintao steps down as party chief in 2012 and president the following year.  Given the paucity of information on Xi Jinping, it is near impossible for the outside world to assess how well qualified he is to run the country.  In a system which has historically relied to a great extent on guanxi, endemic corruption and the buying and selling of official posts, one wonders if the Central Organization Department is really putting qualified people in place to run a country growing in complexity during challenging times.","1 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB083ZLHL6T%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhDxqh%252FPJWNE6EePuIsI6K1jp%252FSGiBGfMUfxjSdsnddPKAAAAAGQvy6IAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR345UZ14EK6W9D&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hDxqh%2FPJWNE6EePuIsI6K1jp%2FSGiBGfMUfxjSdsnddPKAAAAAGQvy6IAAAAB&reviewId=R345UZ14EK6W9D","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

Coming from a multi-party noisy democracy like India, it was always a puzzle as to how a single party system would work, leave alone survive for 70 years. And of course, there were bits and pieces of stories and anecdotes heard over the years about life in China under the party.The author does an extremely detailed job on the topic, presenting the various parts of the CCP - in relation to topics such as businesses, army, history etc. The book is rich with anecdotes, real events that shot to national limelight etc to make us get a ring side feel of what transpired in the 15-20 years upto 2010.Would love to read a sequel that includes the Xi Jinping era.","1 个人发现此评论有用","","","报告","","","",""
