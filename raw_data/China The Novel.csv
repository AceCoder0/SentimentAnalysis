"Bobby D.","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Entertaining trip into 19th Century China's history","2021年9月1日 在美国审核","已确认购买","Edward Rutherfurd is the pen name for Francis Wintie. He follows in the tradition of writers like James Michener writing thick novels that tell fictional family stories covering many centuries of a place’s history. CHINA, Rutherfurd’s newest book is a bit different. Not that it is not long, coming in at 764 pages; but because the story covers only 70 years of Chin’s history from the early 1800 and the Opium Wars to the death of Empress Dowager CIXI in 19o8.The thrust of the plot lines is how Britain and other western powers tried to colonize China resulting in several wars and Chinese anti-western actions (leading up and through the Boxer Rebellion).I am not going to go into detail about the various characters or storylines as I am happy to report they are all entertaining. I would think more so for those not knowledgeable about CHINA and its rocky history in the 1800s.I read someplace that Rutherfurd is at work on a sequel which should be equally fascinating. This book is a great way to dip one’s toes into Chinese history while enjoying several colorful characters and cliffhanger short stories. I enjoyed this book and especially like that it is one you can pick up and read without the demands of finishing it in one large gulp. I found the novel immensely entertaining.The book's early section reminded me a lot of Amitau Ghosh’s IBIS TRILOGY, especially the third book RIVER OF SMOKE about the Opium trade and wars. (I recommend Ghosh’s books highly.) And then there is the wonderful biography, EMPRESS DOWAGER CIXI by Jung Chang. Rutherfurd mentions his differences with her biography in his Afterword. Like any nonfiction work, Chang’s book is dense and offers far greater historical insight than Rutherfurd’s novel. Lastly, one of my favorite Non-fiction authors (who also writes historical novels under the pen name Alex Rutherford is Diana Preston. She and her husband wrote the exciting Empire of the Moghul series. One of Preston’s early nonfiction books is THE BOXER REBELLION. I only mention these books because they may be of interest if you wish to take a deeper dive into this period of history.(I have only read one other Rutherfurd novel, LONDON, which I also enjoyed a great deal.)","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB08FZM45DG%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_arp_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26csrfT%3DhMpp0XiOsEEc1mWyE2rJqW2KcAM2479NDh%252BRDJZnI4%252FLAAAAAGQvw64AAAAB%26reviewId%3DR17ESMT9Q0TSJA&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","7 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hMpp0XiOsEEc1mWyE2rJqW2KcAM2479NDh%2BRDJZnI4%2FLAAAAAGQvw64AAAAB&reviewId=R17ESMT9Q0TSJA","报告","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。","显示条评论"
"Timothy Haugh","4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","In Some Ways, Not a Typical Rutherfurd Novel","2021年10月11日 在美国审核","已确认购买","I generally love Edward Rutherfurd novels when I’m in the mood for them (which is not all the time).  His works of historical fiction are so Rutherfurdian that it’s generally pretty easy to recognize one.  He picks a place (Ireland, New York, Paris, etc.) and takes us back to the very beginning.  He creates a few families and traces them through many generations at key points in the place’s history, ultimately bringing them to the modern day.  It’s all very obviously constructed, and built in books that are very long.  Sometimes that’s just what one wants.That’s why this book is a bit of a surprise.  I couldn’t imagine how Rutherfurd could cover the history of China.  It’s quite outside of his anglo-centric comfort zone.  Turns out, he didn’t cover the history of China.  He starts less than 200 years ago with the events leading up to the Opium Wars and takes us only into the first years of the twentieth century.  Of course, though he does trace a few Chinese characters (the eunuch Lacquer Nail being the best), this allows him to keep his focus on the English traders’ and missionaries’ view of the country.  It’s a bit of a copout.Still, it is a big book and most of those Rutherfurdian qualities are there.  He does a deep dive, and it is interesting to get a view of China’s encounter with the West, forcing conflict between the traditional values of the country and the need to modernize in the face of threat.  For anyone who thinks of China as Mao and communism, it would open eyes.  Still, it’s not quite what I hope for from a Rutherfurd novel.","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB08FZM45DG%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_arp_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26csrfT%3DhKjLnbEQ%252B%252B9OxhTwm7j%252BfKtUH1qhAphfrg9hXQlrw64OAAAAAGQvw64AAAAB%26reviewId%3DR3OLW8MA8GTSLG&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","7 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hKjLnbEQ%2B%2B9OxhTwm7j%2BfKtUH1qhAphfrg9hXQlrw64OAAAAAGQvw64AAAAB&reviewId=R3OLW8MA8GTSLG","报告","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。","显示条评论"

"Mitch BK","4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","A good read but not his best","2021年6月2日 在美国审核","已确认购买","I have read all of his books over many years.  I enjoy the way he introduces characters over many generations, often spanning centuries or longer through the introduction of different families and their descendants over the lengthy time period covered in the novel who are affected by historical events.  His historical research has always been very accurate and he is careful to point out where he is speaking from a historical source and where he has created fiction.This story was a good read but unfortunately he covered a relatively short period of Chinese history and really had many of the characters play pivotal roles throughout the entire time period, which made them a bit less believable as fictional characters.  (It was almost like some of them could have played Zelig in the Woody Allen movie).  I think this variance from the usual style over centuries, or even millennia, took away a bit from the writing appeal.  It also meant that some of the value I like to derive from historical novels of this sort, getting a very long term picture of the development of something I know little about, was lost.All that being said, it is certainly better than most of the garbage put out today.","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB08FZM45DG%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhFutDz4wQUbmzT3DUIoHbwxYtn0SacqSkhl2vWuxPsQ0AAAAAGQvw%252FUAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR13GSKDVNMGP13&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","25 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hFutDz4wQUbmzT3DUIoHbwxYtn0SacqSkhl2vWuxPsQ0AAAAAGQvw%2FUAAAAB&reviewId=R13GSKDVNMGP13","报告","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。","显示条评论"

The novel opens in the first half of the Nineteenth Century, at the beginning of the First Opium War. Rutherfurd introduces his masterful characters consisting of a diverse blend of Chinese families and British and American fortune-hunters and missionaries.I found an interesting perspective of the many cultural differences between China and the Western countries. As I was reading, the shocking acts of bullying and murder lulled me into adopting the Western idea that our societal differences were vast. In thinking about it further, I saw similarities to the West in the casual abuse and outright oppression of the poor and working class. Additionally, I considered the continuing conquest of India and other countries by the British and the full force of the institution of slavery in America. The backyards of the West were abysmally untidy.The military engagements and the fight over international trade in China were not new topics to me, but I think I might be somewhat of an exception in this case. That said, Rutherfurd memorably depicts the conflicts with the well-developed characters populating the story. Armed with knowing some facts about this piece of history, I came away with a richer understanding of the events and now think about them from different viewpoints.Rutherfurd's rich prose paints a captivating portrait of family, romance, and adventure.

Edward Rutherford takes us to the China of the 19th century. The end of the Manchu Dynasty is near and the world of the Mandarins and Confucianism  is fading. China is plagued by Western countries wanting to trade with this secretive and closed country.Author Rutherford is one of my favorite authors because he uses regular people to bring the accurate history he presents to life. His sagas are long, which is wonderful, and his stories are beautifully told. The Opium War, Taiping Rebellion, and Boxer Rebellion allow us to get to know a Mandarin, a Chinese pirate, a beautiful peasant and her family, a British missionary family, a Manchu soldier, a British Opium trader, and best of all the witty and clever “palace person”, a eunuch named Lacquer Nail.Filled with adventure, romance, exciting battles and interesting diplomacy, this book, a “you are there” presentation of history, is a page-turner.","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB08FZM45DG%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhF0OeNxdyHxar3H25NUZeh93a2LffJPQdc%252FOcCWS0vgqAAAAAGQvw%252FUAAAAB%26reviewId%3DRYUTLGWS9Y1Z8&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","13 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hF0OeNxdyHxar3H25NUZeh93a2LffJPQdc%2FOcCWS0vgqAAAAAGQvw%2FUAAAAB&reviewId=RYUTLGWS9Y1Z8","报告","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。","显示条评论"

Character development is not critical in historical fiction and in this book the characters are not particularly interesting--they serve to characterize politics and history, not to enhance your understanding of human nature.  However, the historical insight makes this book a must read--and, it's validity is enhanced by the author's carefully balanced East/West perspective--the western characters, policies, and actions are ambiguous at best and at times indefensible.  For me, this was a welcome balance.  This is not a lecture, it is not about Western or Eastern heroes--it IS an extremely intelligent insight into the second most pivotal era in China's long history.

China is all we hope it will be; sweeping, multigenerational, tragic, triumphant, and as with all Rutherfurd novels, comes complete full circle. If I was alone in the world with a room full of his novels, I could live out my days in complete happiness. With China, your mind is captivated by many varied characters and stories as the hands of time turn. The reader is taken back, and moved forward as events unfold. We are always made more aware, more in tune to history with a Rutherfurd novel, and I am almost sad to end one with the completion of reading. If only it could go on endlessly.

The country has over 5,000 years of incredible history, but the book doesn't even bother with most of it, because apparently ""China"" didn't matter until the British showed up acting in the capacity of a drug cartel and invaded it to force the Chinese to continue to let the British cartel freely peddle addictive drugs on the Chinese. Not only is the choice of starting point and subsequent topics British-centric, but the same goes for the characters. By far the most attention is given to the British characters, with a handful of actual Chinese ones relegated to mostly supporting roles. The story itself and the characters are passably readable, but nothing special. This is not an epic story.

"DCD","1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Mere Cheerleading for the British Conquest of China","2023年1月9日 在美国审核","","This book is not about China, but about how and why the British brought China to its knees from 1840 onward. The title could be Britain's Glorious Asian Adventures. The only real character exploration is done for Western characters, particularly the British that Rutherford understands. The Chinese characters are merely stick figures made from a bundle of stereotypes constituting character flaws. The prejudice is as palpable as dinner conversation at a British colonial club in Asia. The depiction of China is as authentic as food from a West End Panda Express.I read and enjoyed both London and Sarum. Rutherford is clearly at his best writing about his own country and people. What he has done to the Chinese in this book is very hard to read. I have not seen prejudicial characterizations of this kind in years. Just for the readers information, I lived over a decade in Hong Kong and have studied the same history that Rutherford pretends to cover. Another less prejudicial historical fiction narrative you might try if you are interested in the British takeover of the Middle Kingdom is the trilogy from Amitav Ghosh about the Opium Wars.","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB08FZM45DG%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhPFIMG7eSocqtox2FVzYe2%252BkXh0Zod%252B%252FxnnKo2sEby7iAAAAAGQvxAIAAAAB%26reviewId%3DRJ18NLMONI0QK&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hPFIMG7eSocqtox2FVzYe2%2BkXh0Zod%2B%2FxnnKo2sEby7iAAAAAGQvxAIAAAAB&reviewId=RJ18NLMONI0QK","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。",""

"Laura","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Brilliant, sweeping story of China -- 1839-1900","2021年5月16日 在美国审核","","Writing:  5/5  Plot: 5/5 Characters: 5/5A sweeping novel of China from 1839 - 1900,  from the Opium Wars through China’s Century of Humiliation to the suppression of the Boxer rebellion.  It’s the story of the conflicts surrounding the forced opening of China to Western trade, customs, and religion.  The story is told through a variety of characters who span cultures, classes, backgrounds, and professions (including plenty of women characters with different roles, abilities and agendas).  Multiple generations of characters such as a young English merchant trying to make his fortune (through opium), an upright Mandarin charged with enforcing the emperor’s ban of opium, a palace eunuch, a peasant girl, a mercenary pirate, a missionary, a Manchu bannerman, the emperor and various concubines and princes, and some craftsmen.  The characters have depth, too.  They reflect on what is happening, how they feel about their own role, and how to achieve their goals while maintaining their values (or how to shift their values to attain their goals).I love that history itself is the protagonist in this novel, rather than the background setting for individual stories.  Everything is told through the personal stories of the characters — either through participation in the action or through conversations between neighbors, colleagues, and family members.  Even past history is exemplified in ritual and description of the origin of individual morality.  This approach brings to the fore what it was like to live through these times with only direct observations and rumors as sources of information.  And how very different that information was depending on your location, background, profession, culture and connections.  Additionally, there were so many fascinating descriptions of various ways of life — all told in a style that was interesting because someone was learning it (e.g. a craft) or going through it — so always real and never dry.  This was a long book, and I literally had trouble putting it down.  (As a warning, one of these “fascinating” descriptions was about foot binding, and I skimmed through trying not to read that at all.  Of all the atrocities visited upon humans, this is the one I find most horrific and barbaric (yes, even more than female circumcision which comes in a close second).This is my first Rutherfurd and I’m now going back to read more. Meticulously researched, personal and accurate — a kind of modern day Michener for those old enough to remember classics like Tales of the South Pacific, Hawaii, The Source, or Caravans.  After reading this, I have a far more in-depth understanding about the relationship between China and the West and of life in the 19th century.","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB08FZM45DG%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhHIWr4kxEt4YAJzPUa0WSBD3swVw%252F8XdJySRp4%252Fw6S8EAAAAAGQvxAIAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR1M5C131VS24Q&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","13 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hHIWr4kxEt4YAJzPUa0WSBD3swVw%2F8XdJySRp4%2Fw6S8EAAAAAGQvxAIAAAAB&reviewId=R1M5C131VS24Q","报告","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。","显示条评论"

This one covers China from the first opium war to the end of the Qing dynasty. As usual, he has created characters (a British opium trader, a missionary, a Chinese mandarin, a Chinese rebel, a eunuch in the Manchu court, etc) that cover all important events (opium wars, Taiping rebellion, court intrigues, empress Cixi, etc). The book is a fun read and the history is well researched.

"Steven M. Anthony","4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Very Typical Rutherfurd","2021年8月23日 在美国审核","","I’ve read every book written by Edward Rutherfurd, and have found them all to be very readable and educational.  He writes very much in the same style and genre as James Michener, though perhaps just a slight cut below Michener’s best work.This book differs slightly from that of both Michener and Rutherfurd’s previous works, in that it covers a relatively short time frame of 60 years.  It commences with the years immediately preceding the Opium War of the 1840s, focusing on Macau, Canton and the founding of Hong Kong, then progresses through the Taiping and Boxer Rebellions into the early years of the 20th century.As in his previous works, Rutherfurd tells the story of China during the period by looking at the lives of several of the actors, including a British trader, a Chinese peasant woman, a Chinese pirate, a sub-prefect and an imperial court eunuch.  The author alternates story arcs well through the period in question.While the time frame in this case is compressed when compared to his previous work, earlier years of Chinese history are touched upon within many of the story arcs.  If you’ve read Rutherfurd before, you know what to expect and wont be disappointed.  If you’ve read and enjoyed Michener, you’ll find Rutherfurd a worthy successor.","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB08FZM45DG%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhEZ2NzUV5xvb1Qj1hofxYxWkSOFBJavCjLX1SWzdaQXUAAAAAGQvxAMAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR1UZ3ZURHILP7U&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hEZ2NzUV5xvb1Qj1hofxYxWkSOFBJavCjLX1SWzdaQXUAAAAAGQvxAMAAAAB&reviewId=R1UZ3ZURHILP7U","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。",""

It is the first book I’ve read by Edward Rutherfurd, known for writing epic tomes about significant places and times in history, across generations.Set during the Opium Wars, and with his panning of characters on all sides of the issue, I learned so much more about the perspectives of those involved. It was also a deep dive into culture in China, Great Britain, and the world at this significant time. There is a strong sense of adventure and even a touch of romance and drama to this story. I’ll never forget Mei-Lhing, Trader, and a eunuch named Lacquer Nail.Overall, Rutherfurd is adept at presenting well-researched history from all sides and in an approachable, highly readable way.

He is one of my top 5 authors! And this book did not disappoint! He has written about the most wonderfully developed characters, Trader, Laquer Nail, Empress Dowager Cixi! in a novel that includes foot binding!, The Opium Wars, The Taiping Rebellion, The Boxer Rebellion, the Forbidden City and so much more of Chinese history, all of it with the beautiful landscape of the country of China in the background. There is so much in this novel. I loved reading about Mei-Ling, Shi-Rong and Nio and Guanji...that's all I'll say about them since there are no spoilers here.  This is truly a remarkable book by Mr. Rutherfurd! and anyone who loves history will adore this book.  He has done extensive research into the history of China and its dynasties.  It's all there!Thank you to Netgalley and Doubleday Publishers for the galley of this amazing book!","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB08FZM45DG%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhApMiwdjzTpcZKG8FyGKECLzBlweZFjevFncAD5ab%252BdvAAAAAGQvxAMAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR2SZ5ODSR2S34E&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","13 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hApMiwdjzTpcZKG8FyGKECLzBlweZFjevFncAD5ab%2BdvAAAAAGQvxAMAAAAB&reviewId=R2SZ5ODSR2S34E","报告","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。","显示条评论"

I was also pleased to read a long historical novel that does not incorporate the mandatory pornography  found in modern narratives.  There is sex.

The story is set in the final 80 years or so of dynastic China and follows the western powers contribution to the destruction and exploitation of the empire. I was repulsed by the inevitable comparison I could not help but make of western ""trade"" to today's drug cartels. While China was more than capable of self-destruction, western means of exploitation certainly sped the process and did much damage some of which impoverishes us to the current day.. The story is told primarily through the eyes of a British trader, John Trader, whose life and death encompasses the period of the novel, and a member China's royal court that was a close, personal servant of empress Cixi whose life also encompasses the same period. I found myself unable to get overly attached to any of the characters this time around; however, I feel the book gave me a valued perspective and understanding of the path leading to modern day China and associated problems and attitudes the world must struggle through today.","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB08FZM45DG%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhHYh27Znl%252FrmJQxkCQYjV5JY1NKWfb8IHKTUd85uj3gBAAAAAGQvxAUAAAAB%26reviewId%3DRAID03RI7YSD1&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hHYh27Znl%2FrmJQxkCQYjV5JY1NKWfb8IHKTUd85uj3gBAAAAAGQvxAUAAAAB&reviewId=RAID03RI7YSD1","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。",""

You need to understand, or try to understand, another culture. Although this book only goes back to the 1800s, there’s enough earlier history woven in that you learn a lot. It is truly a story of two worlds colliding. The ancient Chinese dynasty and the modern world of the barbarians from Europe.

Unlike Rutherfurd's other historical novels, this one deals with only a short section of the history of China, the mid to late nineteenth century. I was hoping for his usual broad sweep through the millennia, especially with a country like China, whose written history goes back further than most. However, this novel goes in depth into the psyche of China, presented through the eyes of several main characters from a wide spectrum of Chinese society, as well as from the viewpoint of several Westerners. It took a while to get into the book; the Chinese characters were more relatable than the Englishman, John Trader, whose story forms the first section. But in the end I gave it 5 stars as Rutherfurd's research is meticulous and well-rounded. I feel I understand China better now.","","","报告","","5 个人发现此评论有用","","",""
