"Hawkeye","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Another Revealing book on Corruption! “Big help with Little Badmouth!”","2022年12月28日 在美国审核","已确认购买","Red Handed (RH) is the most recent entry into my library by Peter Schweizer.  I have found his works easy to read and understand. RH is no exception!  He is an outstanding writer and Harper is a “no mistake” editor.  Unlike a recent book I reviewed regarding Samuel Adams, I found the prose, sentence structure, and word selection not distracting from obtaining the full meaning of the story.In this work the author involves all aspects of American specialness which China has taken full advantage of to assist its regime to accomplish its geo-strategic goals at the expense of the United States (US).  From it it appears American elites have sold the rope to hang and hand the US to China.  The book exposes US citizens who have translated themselves and their companies’ services into lucrative operations helping Chinese firms while at the same time taking Beijing’s side in its trade dispute with undermining the US.Although this book has no photographs, it is very well constructed, it is well organized with a table of contents for its nine chapters, along with 20 % of the book reference material, and a fine, easy to use index.  After reading this most recent Schweizer piece I immediately sold all my positions of companies exposed in it and you should do the same.This is a magnificent book, in its reporting power, its meticulous research, its simple textual brilliance and chronological narrative.  RH stands “on the top” with other Schweizer contributions of the past.  If all the material referenced in this book is factual, then these stories of corruption make the films “Wolf of Wall Street” and “The Distinguished Gentleman” appear as child’s play!","21 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2F0063061147%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_arp_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26csrfT%3DhALe2p89Rjvmh%252BglzWWi9BfKv%252F%252BEVnqTa05LjiXC0T2XAAAAAGQvymYAAAAB%26reviewId%3DROZ94MMTOMZ95&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hALe2p89Rjvmh%2BglzWWi9BfKv%2F%2BEVnqTa05LjiXC0T2XAAAAAGQvymYAAAAB&reviewId=ROZ94MMTOMZ95","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
"Clancy Hughes","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Sleeping with the Enemy","2022年2月15日 在美国审核","已确认购买","Peter Schweizer bravely outlines the extent to which the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) seduced the Washington elite and many others throughout America. The elite  followed willingly the siren call for unlimited wealth and adulation.Schweizer outlines the double dipping of the Bidens and legislators retiring to become high paid lobbyists for China and more directly the CCP. He described how Cabinet members, diplomats and even retired military engage in the same consulting businesses that initially in the 60s sought engagement, trade and peace, but soon turned to participation in vicious subversion. For Silicon Valley technocracy, the market opportunity for sales to China’s 1.44 billion population was initially an irresistible siren call above all other considerations, and for most the profits outweighed thoughts about our national security. The Author, includes Wall Street financing of the Chinese military with investment products not accountable to our Securities Exchange Commission, including many retirement funds. He goes on to describe the Bush and Trudeau families’ close relations with Chinese officials of the CCP. Don’t  forget Senator Dianne Feinstein or Senator Mitch McConnell and the Chao family of ship builders. Schwartz focuses particularly on Yale University with the massive and mostly unaccounted for Chinese donations and joint programs.This book names names, dates and dollar amounts with a surprisingly long list of persons who’s greed forgoes their honor.  He names a few not so easily seduced and a few of the good. The last chapter makes suggestions: Ban lobbying on behalf of Chinese military- and intelligence-linked companies. Ban Chinese military- and intelligence-linked companies from appearing on US stock exchanges. Ban joint research between Chinese and American universities.  Ban investment in corporations with Chinese military and intelligence projects. Wall Street firms need to consistently apply Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG). —- needs to include National security as well (ESGS)I don’t know how you are going to gain truth in Media companies,  now owned or financed by China. They own Hollywood too.James Mann is the former Beijing bureau chief of the Los Angeles Times and is now a scholar at Johns Hopkins University. He argues that “engagement” is essentially a strategic fraud. Clyde Prestowitz, a longtime observer and author on China matters, believes we should replace engagement with reciprocity. (However, reciprocity cannot exist when one party holds deception as the highest good while the other views truth as the guiding virtue — the Eastern mind set versus the West.Schweizer mentions the unlikely but hopeful agreement between Ted Cruz of Texas and Chuck Schumer of NY in upholding the 1938 Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) and the 1966-2019 Foreign Contributions and Things of Value Act, § 30121 & 303(2). Schweizer seems to leave it to Prestowitz’s view of “reciprocity in Lou of engagement,” and our hope for further agreement between Ted Cruz (R) and Chuck Schumer (D) in closing the loopholes. In any case we must counter Beijing’s elite capture strategy.Our present circumstance deserves remembering the words of Thomas Paine, Christmas Day 1776.“These are the times that try men’s souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country; but he that stands it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered….What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly: it is dearness only that gives everything its value. Heaven knows how to put a proper price upon its goods; and it would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as FREEDOM should not be highly rated.” Thomas Paine 1776We must end all foreign lobbying and deficit trade. Swing the ax, and renegotiate only that which recuperates our middle class and gives meaningful employment to those who struggle. Any reengagement  must rebuild US manufacturing, moral, American jobs, middle class liquidity and National security; and first of all, stop sleeping with the enemy.This book should be required reading for everybody, especially in Washington.","65 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2F0063061147%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_arp_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26csrfT%3DhMk%252B82BdTt9qhYijDsKnpsfJKpWhBdnSzAiBRJrSIhqsAAAAAGQvymYAAAAB%26reviewId%3DREWRQND297MRH&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hMk%2B82BdTt9qhYijDsKnpsfJKpWhBdnSzAiBRJrSIhqsAAAAAGQvymYAAAAB&reviewId=REWRQND297MRH","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

"Wanda M. Keith Rn","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","SCHWEIZER DOES IT AGAIN","2022年2月4日 在美国审核","已确认购买","Peter Schweizer has done it again with a expose of a Government run by elites who become rich from their ties to the very people they were elected or appointed to protect us from. He then takes us to the entertainment and sports elites who have become wealthy beyond our dreams and who bow down to foreign leaders who wish to one day take over our country. One example is LeBron James who refuses to call out China for their treatment of ethnic groups as he is heralded as an idol in China. Schweizer brings us up to date on the Biden Crime Family and how they have become wealthy from their ties to China and Ukraine. However, he presents a fair and balanced book by including members of both parties who have benefited from their previous and current positions. He includes the Bush family, the Trudeau family, the Pelosi's, Kissinger, Gates, McConnell's, Clinton's, etc, who are all recipients of great wealth thanks to China and other foreign powers and Schweizer spells out how it is done. He also digs into big tech, Ivy League universities, and Wall Street. Kissinger once stated, ""When the Chinese don't need us, they are going to be very difficult to deal with.""

As of July 2018, the Foremost Group signed a series of contracts with the China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC) to build ten more ships, including six of the massive 208,000-ton variety.97 The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but similar transactions with other entities buying these large vessels put the price tag over $50 million each.

"Kathleen Mulligan","3.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Missing the globalist problem","2022年4月9日 在美国审核","已确认购买","Lots of eye-opening info in this book, but the underlying theme seems to be ""Why are these Americans helping China and betraying their home country?""  I bet Schweizer understands better now, as so many of us do, that the globalist elite (the World Economic Forum grads, the Bidens, the Trudeaus, the Bushes, the Obamas, the Clintons, etc.) have no loyalty to the U.S. because they seek to ""build back better"" or ""level up"" to a New World Order / one world government wherein they reign.  Along these lines, Schweizer's treatment of Gates is quite naive.  Similarly, his ""what can we do"" chapter suggests that the press can help shed light on problems, but of course we've found out this past year that a bought & paid for media is a huge part of the problem.  So, it's a helpful collection of information, but the analysis of forces in play is weak.","3 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2F0063061147%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhAy9tn0QQWZgRVzU5eVYoOYCrcqj3CleOwDduKdiBGG6AAAAAGQvyn0AAAAB%26reviewId%3DR2VM0QIO6AQR5N&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hAy9tn0QQWZgRVzU5eVYoOYCrcqj3CleOwDduKdiBGG6AAAAAGQvyn0AAAAB&reviewId=R2VM0QIO6AQR5N","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

It's printed on cheap paper, lazily ""perfect"" bound, and is good bathroom reading for 2021 before it gathers dust in a couple years at the local Goodwill next to expired 80's era Clancy novels. The book is full of limited hangouts, red-baiting, and pseudo-outrage, but it's really just a propaganda artifact of The Now, just like his easily forgotten Clinton Cash and Secret Empires or whatever. Richard Blum. refreshingly appears in the index, but the Central Intelligence Agency does not - despite the author being the ""William J Casey Fellow"" at the Hoover Institution (and if you want something 'spooky' - try researching an honest authentic bio of Herbert Hoover). The big failing of this pseudonarrative gussied up as explosive muckraking is that it provides no context: what EXACTLY is going on (overtly and covertly) with the US, China, Banksters, and geopolitics. This goes back to 70's grand strategy and technology transfer, and I'm lost swimming in a bunch of fake pseudo-outraged limited hangouts about nothingburgers like LeBron James. It's not like the author tried to educate the reader about what a ""proprietary"" is, after all. So, stay happy in the current affairs matrix, but don't expect to learn anything.There isn't even a single blurb on the dust-cover endorsing the book by anybody of importance concerned with matters of consequence.","50 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2F0063061147%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhEeSGa%252BftoyyvjZMw3zGQjIxbrCXI2zZHuftkBKuJyuyAAAAAGQvyoQAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR3OO4O0SGSPJWJ&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hEeSGa%2BftoyyvjZMw3zGQjIxbrCXI2zZHuftkBKuJyuyAAAAAGQvyoQAAAAB&reviewId=R3OO4O0SGSPJWJ","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

"Galvanized","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Unbiased analysis of corruption in the rich and powerful","2022年8月22日 在美国审核","","Through eight chapters (237 pages), Schweizer details the slavish relationships between the totalitarian government of Red China and many rich and powerful American individuals, families and organizations.  He backs his writing with 81 pages of small-print reference notes.  He provides details of shady and foul dealings between Chinese government-controlled entities (frequently in the military and espionage realms) with these Americans.  He provides their names (including Barbour, Biden, Boehner, Bush, Dorsey, Feinstein, Gates, Kissinger, McConnell, Pelosi, Swalwell, Trudeau (Canada) and Zuckerberg.  He names entities in Big Tech, Wall Street, academia, sports and politics.  He also provides quotes from some of them, extolling the virtues of the totalitarian government of China (reminiscent of the historical comments from some in America and Europe regarding pre-WW2 fascist Germany).In their pursuit of power and money, these (so-called) “elites” compromise and endanger the people of America, Canada and China (indeed, the whole world).  From a broad perspective, these failures of trust are not surprising.  They explain much that seems so wrong in the world.  But the details and scope of the revelations in this book paint a dark picture- is it too late to reverse course?  Mr. Schweizer’s last chapter (11 pages) is titled “Fighting Back.”  He presents some good ideas and I hope that people of good faith and courage will push back against such evil.  He names a few prominent people who are doing that.How much wealth is enough and what are you willing to do to get more of it?  At what point will greed or blackmail (actual or the fear of it) enslave you and put you on the path to hell?  In chapter 19 of the Gospel of John (vv. 23-24), Jesus says, “Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven.  Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.”I encourage you buy and read ""Red-Handed.""","1 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2F0063061147%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhD0vWsknOfVF4gz9xfAtyQ%252Fj294PZaFCJiTOHKevYFiQAAAAAGQvypwAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR2OBGNE39Y15XE&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hD0vWsknOfVF4gz9xfAtyQ%2Fj294PZaFCJiTOHKevYFiQAAAAAGQvypwAAAAB&reviewId=R2OBGNE39Y15XE","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
"NPS","4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Blah","2022年4月21日 在美国审核","","Whatever is legal is not necessarily moral or safe. So, the author takes us on a ride to meet the usual suspects who try to enrich or empower themselves but ultimately become apologists and boosters of the Chinese dictatorial regime. Needless to say, there is plenty of hypocrisy to spread around, morality and pragmatic considerations are mostly absent, and the game is played at the highest echelons of power.The group of actors includes (X-or not) politicians who sometimes register as foreign agents (like Kissinger and Feinstein), relatives of people in power (like Hunter), relatives of wealthy Chinese (like Mc Connel and Chao), businessmen (like Gates, Chambers, Google dudes, Dorsey, Zuckerberg, etc.), financiers (like Dalio, Schwarzman, Fink, etc.), the NBA, and so on. The list is long.People are bought at lower levels as well, by financing universities and research facilities, journalists, etc.In a real world, you can't stop the mixing of people and exchange of ideas. What one could do is identify a narrow set of objectives and actively target excessive abuses, based on national security concern for example. As Lenin said, “When it comes time to hang the capitalists, they will vie with each other for the rope contract”. The speed and size of technology transfer to China, may facilitate what Lenin said in a commercial and military sense.In the meantime, one can remain cautious of Chinese spin narratives in the media by very powerful people and feel disgust on how leaders place their check book above national interest and almost always against their own long-term interest.Germany’s engagement and dependence on a power with imperial aspirations is the best example. Russia did a good job buying off German politicians ( E.g. Gerhard Schroeder) to take Germany energy hostage. Today, Germany effectively finances Russia’s war efforts in Ukraine. Chimerica’s entanglement may be more difficult to sort out. The writing is on the wall.","1 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2F0063061147%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhHhmIjf%252FZZB%252B95oVN%252F4IUTcW32UALqfLjw5V6DzEVIHHAAAAAGQvypwAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR1JIAOQJTRCMT2&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hHhmIjf%2FZZB%2B95oVN%2F4IUTcW32UALqfLjw5V6DzEVIHHAAAAAGQvypwAAAAB&reviewId=R1JIAOQJTRCMT2","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

"Florida shopper","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","The title is a total understatement!","2022年2月21日 在美国审核","","You can call me Henny Penny, but as far as I'm concerned by virtue of this book, the sky has already fallen. I'm only just starting chapter 4 (thankfully I had a free Audible book credit) and my head has exploded multiple times. I expected the chapter on the Bidens, but the one on Capitol Hill was dreadfully mind blowing. A huge number of former and current senators and House members are lobbying for China! Including my own conservative former Florida Congressman Cliff Stearns!!!! A Christian! If Feinstein isn't a Communist, she is a Sell-Out of the highest order going back to the 70s as mayor of San Francisco. The Swamp is no joke! McConnell is at least a Chinese sympathizer through his wife Elaine Chou and her father and sister, heads of a CCP shipbuilding company!!!Schweizer has done voluminous documentation. The acronyms beginning with the letter C are constant and quickly blur into oblivion which is what my brain feels like. You may consider yourself an informed conservative (or an honest liberal) but you are NOT! Anyone who has not read this book is completely uninformed because no American could ever imagine that so many of our elected leaders are on the take to the tune of hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars (meticulously documented BTW.) Please do yourself a favor even though it will be cognitively painful, and read this book and pass it on. Pass it on to your senator and congressman if for no other reason than to inform him/her that you are onto them and will take appropriate action at the polls in 2022 and 2024 including supporting primary challengers of incumbent Republicans unless they speak out against this rampant corruption to rat it out to the American public which this book has basically done if anyone will read it. But now, in order to save their political butts, elected Republicans and Democrats need to get on board loudly.Of course, if you don't choose to read this book, as far as I'm concerned, you are useful idiots of the CCP. Yes that's strong language, but our military members have taken on America's defense at risk of life and limb; the least patriotic Americans can do is read a book!!!I DARE you to read this book and not be astonished and outraged by the CORRUPTION that DC lives and breathes in.

"Fitness Celebrity","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Riveting. Infuriating. We should have known all this already!","2022年1月26日 在美国审核","","You know that feeling you get when you learn something you didn't already know, then realize you SHOULD have known it before? You'll get that feeling a lot as you read this riveting book.Everyone should know by now that the big Wall Street firms -- like Goldman Sachs and Blackrock -- have sold out to the Chinese already. Of course they have; there's a lot of money to be made there.Everyone should know by now that the Big Tech titans have sold out, too. They want eyeballs to make money, and more money to attract more eyeballs.Everyone should know by now that Joe Biden's family has been in bed with the People's Republic for more than a decade, and Joe's son Hunter and his brothers Frank and James have been the bagmen for the Biden family when Hunter isn't otherwise engaged in hookers and blow, or in his newfound career as an ""artiste.""Everyone should know by now that Harvard and many other major universities in this country have prostituted themselves in pursuit of Chinese ""endowment"" money that comes with an unspoken pledge to censor what the Chinese Communists don't want students to hear or to learn.Everyone should know by now that American politicians can be bought or bought off by new business opportunities that benefit their children or their cronies.But it still does a body good to survey the damage, to see the details, and to get that ""I should have known this"" feeling from this important and timely book.Why is it important? Because China is rapidly reaching the point where they will overtake the US as the predominant superpower in the world. If you don't think a bloodthirsty, dictatorial, communist regime ought to be setting the rules for the civilized world, you had better make your opinion known and acquire the knowledge to help you root out the problem and call China's American helpers out. The truth is, the Chinese can't do it without their help.Why is it timely? Because if you have been paying attention you have seen lots of examples of powerful Americans who suddenly can't bring themselves to notice the Chinese genocide against the Uyghur minority. China is literally exterminating its own citizens, by sterilizing them, imprisoning them in concentration camps, or farming them out as forced labor to companies who make things like that iPhone you can't get out of your hand.Facebook's founder Mark Zuckerberg asking President Xi, China's goon-in-chief, to give his unborn daughter her ""Chinese name"" at a White House state dinner in 2014 is something even I didn't expect to read. But he did it. It's all here in this book. The aptly named Larry Fink, CEO of Blackrock, has been betting your money on China for years. Even Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, the biggest, baddest firm on Wall Street, cowers in fear of hurting their feelings.You know about LeBron James already, I'm sure. You probably remember the obsequious NBA disowning the coach of the Houston Rockets for daring to tweet (tweet!) about the repression of Hong Kong by the ChiComs. You know why? Because they afraid to lose broadcast rights, or money from licensed merch in China. That's here, too, for good measure. I hope they choke on those sneakers.But you will learn how the Chinese have gotten these timid titans to kiss their bottoms. It is the work of years of effort, relationship building, and subtle intimidation. They are masters at it, and the US is their masterpiece.Peter Schweizer's book is straightforward and factual. He writes without fussiness and this book is well paced and very well edited. My main reaction when I finished the penultimate chapter was ""We are so screwed!"" But his concluding chapter offers ways that Americans can fight back by recognizing what China is doing and making it harder to keep doing it. If we don't, they will continue to ratchet up the pressure on those people, and on the businesses and institutions Schweizer names, and we will all be powerless to stop them.","21 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2F0063061147%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhOCRV1OIulUYtU9F3KQtn6v%252F39ji1Ird23iiy2lO%252F95cAAAAAGQvyp0AAAAB%26reviewId%3DRJVJYTELHUMN5&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hOCRV1OIulUYtU9F3KQtn6v%2F39ji1Ird23iiy2lO%2F95cAAAAAGQvyp0AAAAB&reviewId=RJVJYTELHUMN5","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

"Alan F. Sewell","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","A Grim Portrait of the American Elite","2022年1月26日 在美国审核","","“This book paints a grim portrait of the American elite,” writes Peter Schweizer. “I am often accused of creating despair because I expose the corruption of America’s leaders… This is without a doubt the most troubling book that I have written.”Some of it is well known by those who follow Schweizer on TV commentary and have read his previous books CLINTON CASH and PROFILES IN CORRUPTION.  For example, the allegation that most of the Biden Family’s wealth derives from the $31 million Schweizer says was paid to Biden’s son and brother through arms of the Chinese government, including its spy agencies and People’s Liberation Army. Likewise, he alleges that the husbands of Senator Diane Feinstein and Nancy Pelosi have made tens of millions running “a myriad of firms and partnerships” in China --- from Communist Party money funds to limousine companies.He doesn’t neglect to scrutinize Republicans. He says Senator Mitch McConnell has acquired the lion’s share of his wealth from his father-in-law (the father of his wife Elaine Chao) a Taiwanese billionaire who builds ships for China’s government. As has former Republican Speaker of the House John Boehner, who lobbies Congress on behalf of the Chinese government and its military arms. As has former diplomatic war horses Henry Kissinger and Condoleezza Rice who Schweizer says lobby Congress for permission to transfer America’s most sensitive technologies to the Chinese Army. As have some of Trump’s former Cabinet members who were supposed to be helping Trump confront China. And many in the Bush family, including George H.W. Bush, his brother Prescott Bush, his son Neil Bush (also heavily involved in domestic banking controversies), and did Jeb Bush, whose short-lived 2016 campaign Schweizer alleges was partially funded by agents of the Chinese government.He says most tech titans --- from Liberals like Jack Dorsey and Bill Gates to the Libertarian Elon Musk --- are praising China’s government in hopes of profiteering from its market. That goes for most every prominent person in Wall Street finance, academia, and sports and entertainment, and government bureaucracies who seek Chinse payola by facilitating Chinese government infiltration of our economy.“America is in a grim position,” Schweizer concludes. “Beijing’s effort at ‘elite capture’ appears to be working spectacularly. We have exposed how elites, from Washington to Wall Street, from Silicon Valley to academe, have been coopted and are helping the regime while in some cases even bolstering China’s military and intelligence complex. But there are very real things we can do to fight back.”Before reading this book, I would have said that the United States still has a fighting chance to maintain parity with China as a superpower duopoly. Now I am not so sure. China is a monolithic entity of government, business, espionage, and police state sheltering under the umbrella of the Chinese Communist Party. He paints the United States (correctly, I think) as a cacophony of money-grubbing private interests, mostly loyal to Chinese payola and craving to impose a similar dictatorship to stifle dissent among the American public.He holds out a somewhat forlorn hope that there are still a few prominent Americans who he says are properly skeptical of China’s government. Some are Republicans like President Donald Trump and Senators Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, Rand Paul. Some are Democrats like Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senators Joe Manchin, Mark Warner, and Chris Coons. We will need a lot more of those people to stop the transfer of jobs, wealth, and technology to the Chinese Communist Party and its affiliate operations in the military, espionage, and civil government agencies. He concludes on the pessimistic view that:“One can only assume that those who refuse to accurately see it have other motives. As muckraker and novelist Upton Sinclair reminds us, ‘It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it.’”I’m likewise wondering what it will take to break our elites from their love affair with China’s money (formerly Americans’ money transferred to China in trade deficits) and China’s dictatorship. Maybe another Great Recession, an act of overt aggression by China against Taiwan and our Pacific bases, or maybe another president who understands the danger as much as Trump did, but can stay better focused on it.","12 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2F0063061147%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhDnJ5ja4WBIi%252BiB%252BTyANcq1V0akEgv4HPTVvZ6aFByKxAAAAAGQvyp8AAAAB%26reviewId%3DR3QYH2GR2AUATM&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hDnJ5ja4WBIi%2BiB%2BTyANcq1V0akEgv4HPTVvZ6aFByKxAAAAAGQvyp8AAAAB&reviewId=R3QYH2GR2AUATM","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
"Kimberly Marasco","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Heed The Warning","2022年4月5日 在美国审核","","This is by far the most disturbing book I have read on the threat China poses to America's democracy. What is so unsettling is how many of the elite so willingly participate in the demise of this great nation. The author exposes the corruption and greed by the elites, from Washington to Wall Street, Silicon Valley and by many American Universities.  The author does not make any generalized statements...these are well founded, documented, and thoroughly researched accounts of the corruption that exists. We must remain vigilant to the harsh realities and protest against an oppressive regime from taking over our beloved country. If we do nothing, we may very well fall to China's inhumane system of torture, incarceration without trial, massive censorship, and other very barbaric and disgusting tactics. China adopted their regime from Russia and they are equally as corrupt. The real threat is before us and we must focus on...because if we dont, we are doomed. Its that simple. I was a bit disappointed that the last chapter, Fighting Back, was only a few pages and seemed to be mostly directed toward executives and those in Congress who can enforce policies and move the nation toward a brighter future. I would like to have more information about what average citizens can do to make a difference, other than sharing information. It is time to change the direction we are headed for because I know we are going down a very dangerous path. Please read this book and do share it with everyone...maybe start a petition calling for change. Obviously, we must do more.","报告","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2F0063061147%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhMQleDPpkG98HA4%252BaMu8CyryUrqkAz57So2a3Yld5eNxAAAAAGQvyp8AAAAB%26reviewId%3DR1FCUE2F3NB2J8&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","显示条评论","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hMQleDPpkG98HA4%2BaMu8CyryUrqkAz57So2a3Yld5eNxAAAAAGQvyp8AAAAB&reviewId=R1FCUE2F3NB2J8","","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

As citizens, we can be informed about what is taking place by reading books like this and seeing how China is trying to buy our elite so that they can impose policies and spread propaganda that is favorable to the Communist Party of China.  The more people know about what is happening, the more we are able to stop and reverse the present course of action.  We should be suspicious of politicians who are interested in more trade and investments in a communist country like China.

That does not mean all of our leaders are corrupt, but what has been been shown accurately in this book more people need to be held accountable. This includes currently governmental, business and all those identified in chapter headings. Peter S does us great service in this exposure. It used to be the news media that exposed this type of moral corruption, but they are lacking.

They repress the Uighars and Tibetans (Dalai Lama exiled), they have no judicial due process, they have surveillance cameras everywhere, they don't have free speech, there are no elections.

Ever wonder why popular athletes like LeBron James never speak ill of China? It is all about money and lucrative deals that the Communist Chinese Party makes with individuals and companies in exchange for influence and access. China has bought it's way into our universities, tech companies and almost every facet of our society. The Biden family is bought and paid for and has been for many years. Al this is documented thoroughly.Even the main stream press has largely bought into the lie that China is our friend. While we arm the Ukraine to ward off an invasion from Russia, China licks it's chops at the prospect of invading Taiwan. We buy their cheap products and support their military and spy machine and pretend that we are without blame but we are only strengthening China in their quest of world domination.Peter Schweizer backs everything up with documentation. The book is easy to read and I might even say that it is a must-read.","71 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2F0063061147%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhL3Z7IdgvGyjk%252BRo8dzdSAvQPmmp7LbfC16iSxITx%252BEoAAAAAGQvyqcAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR2P4ETFQALA1DC&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hL3Z7IdgvGyjk%2BRo8dzdSAvQPmmp7LbfC16iSxITx%2BEoAAAAAGQvyqcAAAAB&reviewId=R2P4ETFQALA1DC","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

As Peter documents such corruption in his fabulous book, the more it confirms (according to Peter) that Americans are SO VERY TIRED of these politicians on both sides of the isle, Big Tech executives (& other corporate American executives) “selling out” our country, especially after so many brave Americans (& our allies) have “GIVEN THEIR LIVES” [aka have been killed/murdered] in their fight to preserve America’s freedoms.As Peter states in his book, how can these “sell-outs” (that Peter specifically documents in the book) even show their faces in public?!!! Peter states that we need “REAL Congressional hearings” & an “impeachment of Biden & Harris”, & “indictments of both high-level executives & especially politicians”, like “Pelosi” as well as any & all of their criminally involved “family members”, who sold out America to our enemies—-especially the Chinese government (CCP). [Emphasis added].PETER ASKS in his book,“WHY are these politicians so focused on Jan 6th, & not:•the ORIGIN of the CV-19 virus that he believes most likely emanated from 1 of the 2 (Level 4) labs in Wuhan [note: Peter in this book is in exact agreement with  Dr. Francis Boyle who wrote the U.S. Biological Weapons Act] ; &/or•the BILLIONS of DOLLARS that the Chinese government has spent to buy out America’s politicians—[i.e., Peter states that 31 million dollars went to the Biden family alone, including Joe Biden who funneled the money through his various family members like his son?”]. [Emphasis added].Peter further writes that 31 million dollars the Biden family has received from the CCP, Russia, Ukraine, etc., does NOT even include “the 1/2 BILLION that the CCP gave Hunter Biden through CCP shell  companies”.[Emphasis added].Thank you Peter for all your hard work on this EXCELLENT piece of American literature, & for your documentation & thoroughness of this book.","9 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2F0063061147%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhMhV%252BffmF5eFYWkuPbMWhV1O2kbtBfJ2s29stQCGHeaaAAAAAGQvyqkAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR2HAH8POCK3YZ3&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hMhV%2BffmF5eFYWkuPbMWhV1O2kbtBfJ2s29stQCGHeaaAAAAAGQvyqkAAAAB&reviewId=R2HAH8POCK3YZ3","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

Extensively researched and footnoted, it brings to light the patterns of shady dealings by some of America's highest-level officials and business leaders.  These are people whose actions (when uncovered) may seem merely incompetent or irrational, but below the surface are designed to line the pockets and further the objectives of business and political elites while tearing down the overall fabric of American society.  This is not an unsubstantiated hatchet job by some hack or nut case, but instead a clear documentation of events which have been cloaked in secrecy by the perpetrators and the media to the detriment of the general public.","3 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2F0063061147%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhLTtaR2uwkFiX4yaZXLmatzLGfHTuEsurYbzPeQW%252BHjjAAAAAGQvyqoAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR3PPHROONH1GJD&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hLTtaR2uwkFiX4yaZXLmatzLGfHTuEsurYbzPeQW%2BHjjAAAAAGQvyqoAAAAB&reviewId=R3PPHROONH1GJD","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

Having read his previous book “Profiles in Corruption”, I couldn’t wait to read this book. The corruption goes all around, Democrats, Republicans, Wall Street, Hollywood, ad infinitum. It’s much worse than I actually thought and it’s very concerning.Really, it’s all about money. The Chinese have it and folks here in the United States and globally want the money. Forget integrity, forget what’s good for those around you. The Chinese money is seductive to the point that people just lose who they are. This book just blew my socks off to see how the Chinese have infiltrated every way possible into what was once a country that was not dependent in any way shape or form on the Chinese.It’s just a dirty little secret of what happens especially with government officials when they leave office how they immediately  cozy up to the Chinese. Or, not so secret, just look at Hollywood or Disney for example and their double standard when it comes to doing business with China. It’s all in this book and it will shock you and worry you. As it should! He won’t be able to put this book down.","报告","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2F0063061147%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhCoECvKquDrKBRiRXU2FBfng9as1TDzh3xGJey1UVsTPAAAAAGQvyqoAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR2WZZC9UIFYHPQ&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","显示条评论","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hCoECvKquDrKBRiRXU2FBfng9as1TDzh3xGJey1UVsTPAAAAAGQvyqoAAAAB&reviewId=R2WZZC9UIFYHPQ","","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

"Jules","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","This author never disappoints!","2022年1月26日 在美国审核","","If you happen to see any review less than 5 stars or with any negative remarks, please be warned that they will be done from the perspective of those desperate to change the narrative and will obviously be political given this author researches quite thoroughly and accurately and is sharing crucial information that every single American absolutely needs to know.If more people read the works of Peter Schweizer, then we would not currently be in the disastrous political situation we are in now as a nation. The more aware we become of what this author is trying to convey, the better chance we have of avoiding more of such unconscionable actions by those in whom many place their trust-but shouldn't.I decided to gobble up this fascinating book via Audible version, which is tough considering my usual habit of highlighting much of what Peter Schweizer writes to revisit later, but it's done in a pleasant voice and easy to follow. I might still read the regular version but in the meantime wanted to share the strong recommendation to pick up a copy of Red Handed today.

"Chad M","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","China's influence in America.  Cash donations are the norm in Congress.  Is it time for new goals?","2022年2月10日 在美国审核","已确认购买","From normal trade in the 1990s and 2000s to excess lobbying and cash donations in the 2010s and 2020s the US-China relationship has changed substantially.  China, the return great power, is focused on economic and military power.  The US, or many in upper class Americans, are also focused on economic power and wealth, a strength and a weakness at the same time.  This makes for a potentially tragic scenario.The author provides numerous detailed examples of cash influence and the exchange of shares in Chinese companies for influence.  In Congress the access to power is apparently open to US citizens and US corporations and foreigners alike.  Policy and votes move one way or another depending on where cash donations flow.  The American people hope for and believe that the country will be the same in the next 50 to 100 years.  There is apparently no vision for 2050, 2100, or the next one hundred or two hundred years.  While some authors write about a better future the actual programs that support freedom, prosperity, and security are few and far between, compared to the advancements in nations with a higher quality of living and better public education.  In the US it is even fashionable among some groups to deny, avoid, and ridicule stronger government and a larger industrial base that are essential to future success.Since there is no national consensus and investment in the long-term future corporations, many families, and the Congress shift one way or another and pursue short-term profits.","5 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2F0063061147%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhEweuFKAEijTpmjOONN9dipPKYMeBFJmWeIeUKaq7O7OAAAAAGQvyrUAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR2DIH0174I007L&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hEweuFKAEijTpmjOONN9dipPKYMeBFJmWeIeUKaq7O7OAAAAAGQvyrUAAAAB&reviewId=R2DIH0174I007L","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

"MandalorianJedi","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","A Striking Exposure of American Elites Corrupted by the Communist Chinese Government.","2022年2月28日 在美国审核","","The content of Red-Handed is both tremendous and horrifying.  The deep financial and political ties between American elites, of all political affiliations, and high ranking members of the despotic Communist Chinese Party (CCP) leave one breathless.Red-Handed is very well written.  Author Peter Schweizer has taken a truly staggering amount of information and presented it in a way that is very easy to comprehend.  It is also thoroughly research, by Schweizer, who is an expert in the craft, to the point of actually quoting from Hunter Biden’s emails from Hunter’s own laptop, of which Schweitzer is in possession.  Not to be outdone in his thoroughness, Schweizer also corroborates Hunter’s emails with the emails of Hunter’s own business partner.But make no mistake, the corruption goes far beyond the Persistent’s wayward son, from politicians at the highest levels of government to the tech and financial sectors, even as far as professional athletes.  All have been sucked in by the vast fortunes to be made from China, built off slavery and genocide, and “ultra efficient” authoritarian Chinese system of government.  While some may simply start as opportunists hoping to exploit out of China what CCP has exploited out of its own people, they are required to deflect or defend against even the most terrible acts of the CCP and denounce their own countries.

The deep financial and political ties between American elites, of all political affiliations, and high ranking members of the despotic Communist Chinese Party (CCP) leave one breathless.Red-Handed is very well written.  Author Peter Schweizer has taken a truly staggering amount of information and presented it in a way that is very easy to comprehend.  It is also thoroughly research, by Schweizer, who is an expert in the craft, to the point of actually quoting from Hunter Biden’s emails from Hunter’s own laptop, of which Schweitzer is in possession.  Not to be outdone in his thoroughness, Schweizer also corroborates Hunter’s emails with the emails of Hunter’s own business partner.But make no mistake, the corruption goes far beyond the Persistent’s wayward son, from politicians at the highest levels of government to the tech and financial sectors, even as far as professional athletes.  All have been sucked in by the vast fortunes to be made from China, built off slavery and genocide, and “ultra efficient” authoritarian Chinese system of government.  While some may simply start as opportunists hoping to exploit out of China what CCP has exploited out of its own people, they are required to deflect or defend against even the most terrible acts of the CCP and denounce their own countries.  One might say they are called on to deny or defend the plank in the CCPs eye, while boisterously denouncing the speck in the eye of their own homeland.  Perhaps the cognitive dissidence becomes too much to contend with because a large number seem to become true believers in the “efficiency” of the authoritarian CCP and turn their backs on Freedom.Red-Handed should not only be read by everyone with an interest in preserving political, social, religious, and financial freedom from the spread of authoritarianism; but this book should be discussed and debated on every self-respecting news program.

"Drjackl","4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","excellent book","2022年2月2日 在美国审核","已确认购买","I knew that politicians and universities were deeply connected to China, just because of the money involved. One of my former business partners was a Clinton crony with strong ties to the DNC. He and his DNC buddies were traveling to China, starting businesses and partnerships with China and generally raking in money. It seemed wrong to me so I cut off my relationship. At the same time George Mason University connected with the Confucious Institute and began getting donations. That was 2005-2006. Since then, things have gotten worse by orders of magnitude. When you read this book, you'll see the tip of the iceberg. Politicians all kinds, high profile athletes, elite universities and big businesses are grabbing tons of money and flying top cover for china even when its bad for the USA. Read this book. It just scratches the surface of how bad things are, but it shows that we're in trouble. The last chapter, on how we fight back is worth the price of the book. We need to start holding our politicians, universities and businesses accountable for what they are doing, before it's too late.","40 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2F0063061147%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhEmjQFmjhu3JNghtXjFsvLcYQB1wwpQXSuj5s8FzqKVkAAAAAGQvyrgAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR2PNA7LAQEDYU2&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hEmjQFmjhu3JNghtXjFsvLcYQB1wwpQXSuj5s8FzqKVkAAAAAGQvyrgAAAAB&reviewId=R2PNA7LAQEDYU2","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

The book, released last month, was the result of the well-documented research that he and his team did over the past year. It is mind-boggling the number of American government officials, that once they leave office, form a consulting business on China, such as former Senator William Cohen. The moment he was out of office, he established the Cohen Group. There are a whole lot of “Groups” of former American officials.This reader liked how Peter Schweizer did the Table of Contents. The American Elites that got rich and helping China win are categorized by content. There is Capitol Hill. There is Silicon Valley. There is Wall Street and on and on. The Bidens are special. They got one content/chapter just for themselves: The Bidens. Not just Hunter, but his uncle Jim and his father Joseph Robinette Biden Junior. One will shake their head, how open are the unlawful activities of the Biden Group. While Hunter is being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Internal Revenue Service, the investigation has been going on for a very long time. Does one really think that there will be any indictments prior to 2024?When Joe Biden was vice-president, Hunter Biden had Secret Service protection, as he does now. After Hunter got going with his new China activities, he informed the Secret Service that he no longer required their protection on his China trips. He would use their protection when he travelled to other countries, but not China. One wonders why?When reading the chapter on Silicon Valley, one wonders, when we do have a war with China, whose side will the high-tech tycoons be for? They might be American, but in a war, their allegiance might be elsewhere.What is with these San Francisco girls, Dianne Feinstein and Nancy Pelosi? Feinstein was never a critic of China, although in the early years Nancy was. Her attitude eventually changed once her husband and son started doing deals in China. The deals became and bigger and the Pelosi family became richer and richer.By the time this reader finished Red Handed, he was worn out. The list of those getting rich and helping China win simply continued to grow. This reader has had a 30-year involvement with China. It began that November day in 1980 when he and a Northwest Airlines plane full of American businessmen & women landed in Beijing. This was the first official U.S. government sponsored trade exhibition to China. We felt we were pioneers and worked hard to achieve success for our corporations and country. That has certainly changed over the years.Thank you, Peter Schweizer and team.

"Ronald A Feaster","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","RED AMERICA","2022年2月9日 在美国审核","已确认购买","There is no pleasant way to describe cancer and how it effects the body. But that is exactly what has happened to the body of America. This book pretty much confirms and documents what I have believed and witnessed for well over 35 years, though it has been going on for closer to 60 years, maybe more. I am totally convinced there is no turning back because our politicians (of both parties) and corporate America have been drinking the red cool-aid for too long.Made in America has been replaced with MADE IN CHINA.So how should we Americans look at this cancerous body that we no longer recognize? Let me put it this way....things are not falling apart, they are falling into place. Just as Jesus said they would.","8 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2F0063061147%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhGhHdtuyif1xN60CAAYUeMzfXWlOnqlaJc%252BFaGsV1DBlAAAAAGQvyr0AAAAB%26reviewId%3DR1SLA1G736CDU8&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hGhHdtuyif1xN60CAAYUeMzfXWlOnqlaJc%2BFaGsV1DBlAAAAAGQvyr0AAAAB&reviewId=R1SLA1G736CDU8","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
