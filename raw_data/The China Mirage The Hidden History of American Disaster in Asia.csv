"S. Ferguson","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","The delusional arrogance of an elite!","2015年8月7日 在美国审核","已确认购买","James Bradley cuts and clears out the obfuscating rot of lies and self-deceit. Are the 'elite' always victims of their own monumental bloated egos? We ordinary mortals prefer to believe that the people in charge of the world - and our money - at least have some semblance of competence. In fact, it seems that we would prefer to believe that there is a well-calculated massive conspiracy of which only the perpetrating insiders know the final end, rather than consider the unacceptable idea that those in charge, the infamous powers-that-be are actually stupid, uninformed and worse — deluded.After 9/11 bewildered Americans asked, ""Why do they hate us?"" The rest of the world laughed at our ignorance. The world now hates America. This sad fact is something I have personally experienced from living in New Zealand for the last seven years. I recently returned home. Our once trusted leaders in their arrogance have squandered all our good will. Yet I continue to meet and know so many decent, hard working, honest people here in the USA. If we Americans can begin to see ourselves as the rest of the world sees us, maybe we still have a chance at redemption — before it is too late.""The China Mirage, The Hidden History of the American Disaster in Asia"" by James Bradley might forever obliterate any Disneyland-fantasy we still hold dear about our fearless leaders. Bradley chronicles the deluded misconceptions regarding China held by the power elite in the west — delusions, 'mirages' that led to years of disastrous policies and unnecessary wars because of complete ignorance, arrogance and a blind stupidity that reigned from the time of the East India Company's Opium Trade (drug running) in China, through Japan's invasion of China and the Rape of Nanking, right on into Pearl Harbor and World War II, and continuing through the Korean War and the Vietnam tragedy. All because of the ignorance, incompetence, and racial arrogance that created a true believer 'mirage' in America regarding China.This book hurt, compelling me to reconsider as false whatever misguided beliefs I still had about my own country. I felt deceived, again betrayed. Viet Nam was my generation. Back in the 1960s I had realized that the Viet Nam war was not about stopping communism, but rather for corporate profit and aggrandizement of the military industrial multinationals. I had friends there who told me things, but James Bradley's 'China Mirage' taught me what I did not know.I did not know that the Delano family, as in Franklin Delano Roosevelt, made their fortune by dealing opium in China. Opium funded/built the British Empire and was one of ""the critical engines of the era."" In India, the East India Company had control over ""one million Indian opium farmers."" Many, as they love to say 'old money' east coast families who now consider themselves the 'blue-bloods' of America, originally got their fortunes in the opium trade. Warren Delano was one.I did not know that Franklin Delano Roosevelt had no qualms about creating a secret government to avoid a pesky Senate & Congress and carry out his policies covertly. Sound familiar? I did not know that the man who founded TIME magazine, Henry Luce was the source endless distorting propaganda. ""Luce was the missionary, the believer, a man whose beliefs and visions, and knowledge of Truth contradicted and thus outweighed the facts of his reporters [David Halberstam]."" Henry Luce's publications beginning in the 1920s held the American people captive, and hypnotized them into believing that China could be ""Christianized""  — and that Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek was America's friend, a Christian on ""the side of the angels"" who would be the 'savior' of the Chinese people needing ""Jesus and Jefferson""!In reality Chiang Kai-shek was little more that a henchman for the notorious Charlie Soong family who had learned how to siphon millions of dollars off deluded American governments and missionaries by promising to promote the Americanization of China, Democracy and Christianity. The money was used for the Soong's own wealth and power in China, and by continually influencing American sentiment through the 'China Lobby' and Henry's Luce's publications.Charlie Soong had gone to the United States as a laborer, but found himself the poster-boy for Southern Methodist missionaries in North Carolina obsessed with converting all of China into Christians. Charlie Soong was awarded a degree in theology in 1885. Back in China he preached Christianity, but quickly realized his fellow countrymen had no interest in becoming Christians or being Americanized. However, Charlie realized ""there was a lot of money to be earned from American Christians"" who believed in their mirage of China.Charlie Soong had three daughters and a son, who for years played an enormous role in the China Lobby, which kept Roosevelt and the American public spellbound in the 'mirage' that China could be Americanized. The eldest daughter, Ailing Soong is described in 1925 as ""the most powerful person in China"" and by the FBI as ""an evil and clever woman [who] sits in the background and directs the family."" Another daughter, Mayling Soong was married to Chiang Kai-shek, who favored wealthy Chinese bankers and landlords that lived off peasant labor. These people bilked the United States for millions of taxpayer dollars.Again I did not know that the USA had kept Japan supplied with oil for its war on China right up to 1941. Money was needed to recover from the Great Depression cause by the Wall Street crash, caused by... ...well, you know. According to Bradley, another 'mirage' was eventually created to convince the American public that the Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek was ""bravely fighting the Japanese"" and that there would be no repercussive blowback suffered by cutting the oil supply to Japan. Pearl Harbor changed that perception. One hundred thousand Americans and over two million Japanese perished in the Pacific WWII.In 1948, one of the Soong daughters, Mayling, came to the United States looking for more money. President Truman later said this: ""I discovered after some time, that Chiang Kai-shek and the Madame (Soong) and their families...were all thieves, every last one of them. And they stole seven hundred and fifty million dollars out of the 3.5 billion we sent to Chiang. They stole it...Every damn one of them ought to be in jail...""It was Japan's occupation of Korea that allowed it to initially invade China. Korea was divided, but the plan to reinvigorate Japan's economy after the war ""called for Korea, Vietnam and other Asian countries to be the supply/consumption machines within the U.S./Japanese orbit."" This proved disastrous and according to Bradley ignited the Korean War, then Vietnam, and the Chinese revolution. In 1950, ""The North Koreans attacked the South because of fears that Japan's industrial economy and its former position in Korea were being revived by recent changes in American policy.""The war in Vietnam also emerged from ignorance and delusion. Ho Chi Minh was committed to ending foreign domination of Vietnam, just as the American Revolutionaries had kicked the British out in 1776. But Eisenhower saw Ho Chi Minh ""as a tool of international Communism."" Eisenhower instead chose a man to rule who was ""allied with the wealthy, who kept the peasants in near servitude"" — a Catholic in a mostly Buddhist Vietnam.So many lost their lives in Vietnam — and for what? Former secretary of defense Robert McNamara later explained that, ""Our government lacked experts for us to consult to compensate for our ignorance. ...There were no senior officials in the Pentagon or State Department with comparable knowledge of Southeast Asia...The irony of this gap was that it existed largely because the top East Asian and China experts in the State Department...had been purged during the McCarthy hysteria of the 1950s...I badly misread China's objectives...totally misunderstood the nationalist aspect of Ho Chi Minh's movement.""The primary delusional characters in this long tragedy are Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Henry Stimson, Pearl Buck (yes, that 'Good Earth' was propaganda!), Henry Luce (founder of the TIME magazine empire), Claire Chennault (an incompetent Captain in the U.S. Army Air Corps who became a mercenary for Chiang Kai-shek), and Joseph McCarthy (who ruined countless creative lives in his obsessive paranoia). These were the misguided 'true believers' who longed to make an ancient culture they literally knew nothing about, into their ideal of a New China founded on 'Jesus and Jefferson'. Their search was as Bradley says, for a mirage that never was and never will be, a search that resulted in the deaths of millions of innocent men and women duped by their delusions. True Believers are truly dangerous.James Bradley is the son of one of the men who raised the American flag on Iwo Jima. His astonishing book, The China Mirage, bravely peals off layers of deception and lies that have been kept from the American people through the 20th century — and haunt us still as we fight through the mire of propaganda that threatens to destroy what we have held high, the ideals of freedom and the Bill of Rights.In Taking the Risk out of Democracy: Corporate Propaganda versus Freedom and Liberty, Alex Carey says that we the American people have been subjected to a 75-year long multi-billion dollar intentional assault on our freedom to think and to choose. ""...propaganda techniques have been developed and deployed (in the United States)...to control and deflect the purposes of the domestic electorate in a democratic country in the interests of the privileged segments of that society.""The idea that Americans might be the most brain washed country on the planet is confirmed by James Bradley's book, The China Mirage. In 1927, Harold Lasswell wrote ""Propaganda Techniques in World War I"" and suggested that, ""familiarity with the behavior of the ruling public (meaning those who had so easily succumbed to the propaganda) has bred contempt... as a consequence, despondent democrats turned elitist, no longer trusting intelligent public opinion, and therefore should themselves determine how to make up the public mind, how to bamboozle and seduce in the name of the public good..."" Alex Carey: ""propaganda has become a profession. The modern world is busy developing a corps of men who do nothing but study the ways and means of changing minds or binding minds to their convictions.""Thank you, James Bradley. I would imagine it took a great deal of courage to write this book. I wish my Mother & Father and the generation before me had known the truth. Maybe they would not have been so hard on my generation - the first in history that dared to say ""No, we won't go""!","11 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00U9SEGJY%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_arp_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26csrfT%3DhH0f8x%252F36ADT%252F3QJL4%252B8V777uwEeWd3eHIAMFa5MupPFAAAAAGQvx1YAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR1AF42MDMJGA57&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hH0f8x%2F36ADT%2F3QJL4%2B8V777uwEeWd3eHIAMFa5MupPFAAAAAGQvx1YAAAAB&reviewId=R1AF42MDMJGA57","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
"Alan Dale Daniel","3.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Slightly Slanted View of US China Relationship","2021年8月29日 在美国审核","已确认购买","SPOILER ALERT.  THE CENTRAL BOMBSHELL OF THE BOOK IS DISCLOSED HEREINAFTER.  The author is a wonderful and engaging writer.  His research disclosed a terrific secret about how the US stumbled into WWII with Japan because of our long warped interaction with China.  Our involvement began in earnest when several founders of some of our richest families made their initial fortunes through the China opium trade.  That seed money, which was in fantastic amounts, was intelligently increased with sharp investments that soon separated them from any criminal activity.  They were fantastically rich and powerful.  Along the way, while the powerful founders were in China plying their trade, they made close friends of several Chinese missionaries who convinced them China could be western and Christian.  The rich men began to support the missionaries in China and sponsor campaigns in the US and UK to further the efforts to westernize and convert to Christianity most of China.These efforts devolved into a string of deceptions about China being much like the west.  A powerful China lobby grew into a machine having huge impacts on American opinion.  After numerous other misadventures, this lobby began pushing for the US to go to war with Japan after Japan invaded China.STOP READING HERE IF YOU WANT TO DISCOVER THE FOLLOWING SECRETS FOR YOURSELF.During the Roosevelt Administration a split developed between his most powerful departments.  The Secretary of State and the US President both wanted to avoid war with Japan and wanted to keep selling oil and raw materials to Japan, which they would use against the Chinese.  Without the oil Japan’s military could not continue to fight Chiang in China.  Several other cabinet secretaries and members of the Federal bureaucracy wanted to support China and wanted to cut off American, and other sources of oil, to Japan.  The Secretary of State and the President were certain that cutting off the oil to Japan would lead to a Japanese attack on America and the Dutch and the UK.  Japan would secure the oil by force if the west stopped selling it to them, the Secretary and President were sure.The opposition in the cabinet had been convinced by the China lobby that Japan would not even contemplate an attack on the US.  The China lobby, which included Madam Chiang and powerful elites in the US, took steps behind Roosevelt’s back to cut off the oil.  They altered important documents, alterations found by the President’s attorney and reported to him, and then rearranged  key bureaucratic committees that eventually stopped the oil from getting to Japan.  After the oil was cut off, Japan attacked the US, UK, Dutch, and their allies across the Pacific.The China lobby couldn’t have been happier.  Money and other help flowed to Chiang in massive amounts; however, every step of the way Chiang and the Nationalists were stealing millions.  Mao was ignored and he turned against the US because of our heavy support for Chiang.These are the author’s contentions, not mine.I think the argument that Japanese policy in China was immoral is correct.  And I think America could have stopped selling oil and other war supplies to Japan years earlier, say 1934, after Japan refused to stop its takeover of China.  The author addresses my complaints, but not effectively I think.  In my opinion the book pushes the idea that American bureaucracy caused the war, and once the oil had been stopped Roosevelt could do nothing because of the China lobby and America’s misunderstanding of China.  Why was no one fired after disobeying direct orders, and after Japan’s attack  had shown the fallacy of the thinking behind stopping the flow of oil?  None of this was explained.  This, and other obvious defects materially decreases the author’s arguments.It is nonetheless an excellent book that you should read for yourself and reach your own opinion.AD2","6 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00U9SEGJY%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_arp_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26csrfT%3DhBI1UqjlQIrvQV3VBTQsrHjwzfc2x2fKjvVdRvbo2hAxAAAAAGQvx1YAAAAB%26reviewId%3DRQ19CHT3LL31I&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hBI1UqjlQIrvQV3VBTQsrHjwzfc2x2fKjvVdRvbo2hAxAAAAAGQvx1YAAAAB&reviewId=RQ19CHT3LL31I","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
"California Reader","4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","The Great Game today","2019年7月31日 在美国审核","已确认购买","This week I've been thinking about the current Hong Kong street protests while also reading the latest Pentagon policies about the new battlefield of the ""Indo-Pacific"" theatre which names Communist China as an enemy for trade and world influence.  And, today I finished reading Bradley's book which makes a case that FDR raised with childhood fantasies about China and Japan helped to speed events leading directly to the Pearl Harbor attack, the Korean and Vietnam wars, as well as, I'd argue, some of the current mess between the USA and China today.China expands its borders by building new South China Sea islands. It rattles its sabers again at Hong Kong and Taiwan. It says to the USA if you are not nice to us in trade power games, we'll cozy up to Russia.  China and the USA are playing an ever more expensive game of cat & mouse with ships, submarines, missiles, and aircraft.  China still supports the continued existence of its buffer state of North Korea against threats it sees from its historic enemies (or tributary states) of Korea and Japan which both have many American offensive military bases a short flight away from China.As other reviewers have said, this book has some careless typos such as the type of aircraft which firebombed Japan to a biased silence on the horrors of Mao's Cultural Revolution and his silence on the roll of the Japanese military-industrial zaibatsus - funded in large part by Wall Street - before and after WWII which I'd agrue caused Pearl Harbor more than any of Teddy Roosevelt's or FDR's China fantasies. But, the book does raise some new perspectives on US/China history worthy of being read today.It is chilling to read this book and compare the escalating Pacific Rim events of today with how FDR in Washington DC so badly misunderstood China having been completely seduced by his childhood fantasies of China so well explained by Bradley.  It is also chilling to know from Mr. Bradley so much about the USA's policies and actions in Asia, especially those from 1945 -1950 are still classified about funds flowing to Chiang Kai-shek just as many details are still classified about how the Japanese imperial family and the military-industrial zaibatsus were able to loot with impunity so much gold and other treasure from the many countries Japan conquered with the active help of the USA and Switzerland after the WWII fighting ended so the Free World could fight the Evil Communists.WWII is still not over for the US and China.  They don't yet trust each other to tell each other the time of day.  Too much old baggage and old secrets.  Too much Great Game squabbling.Now we have Mr. Trump instead of FDR and a new Chinese president-for-life like Putin clinging to his precarious one-party power like the old corrupt Chinese emperors or the doomed Russian tzars while the Japanese zaibatsus still run their own country as they did on December 7, 1941.  I hope Mr. Tump will declassify all the USA's secrets from Teddy Roosevalt's day til the end of the Viet Nam war so we can all see how we really got where we are today on the Pacific Rim.","1 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00U9SEGJY%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_arp_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26csrfT%3DhJSs8zUY%252BnqGTiK61d0pWSe6Y1jKz3IG7D8BB65mt7CBAAAAAGQvx1YAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR2AWQWOMOKIOB1&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hJSs8zUY%2BnqGTiK61d0pWSe6Y1jKz3IG7D8BB65mt7CBAAAAAGQvx1YAAAAB&reviewId=R2AWQWOMOKIOB1","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
"J. Bray","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","SO? WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE?","2015年8月6日 在美国审核","已确认购买","This is an extremely interesting book! If only half of what the writer writes is true it would be mind-boggling. He includes so many footnotes that it would take an historian very little effort to find out any errors in the author’s story if there were any so this would make it seem that most of what he states is probably true. And it straightens out a lot of the whitewashing that has been done to the history of the relationship between America and the East Asian countries for the past couple of centuries in our grade and secondary schools. And everywhere else.However, I have one very important question to ask the author: “What should have been done?” What does he seem to be implying for how the FDR Administration should have acted in regard to militarist Japan in 1941? He doesn’t actually spell it out in so many words but he seems to be intimating that we should not have cut off the supply of oil and gasoline to Japan the way we did in the 1940’s. But think about this just a little bit! If we had not cut off the supply of oil and gasoline to Japan, they would have kept up their bombing of China unopposed by a good air force. They would have kept up their war against China without interference from us. They would not have attacked the United States so we would not have entered a war with the Empire of Japan. Hence Adolph Hitler would not have declared war against us. We would therefore not have supplied large amounts of military aid to England and the Soviet Union nor entered the war against the Nazi forces. Would this not have allowed Japan to take over the rest of China? Then take over the rest of Southeast Asia and India? And the South Pacific countries including Australia? Would this not have allowed Nazi Germany to continue their war, with no opposition from us, against the Soviet Union? And after taking over the Soviet Union and the Mideast oil fields, would they not have turned their entire attention to conquering Great Britain? And after taking over Great Britain, Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy together with their ally, the Empire of Japan would they not have taken over the whole continent of Africa? Who was to stop them? Not us! We would still be neutral. We would still be isolationist. We would still not have wanted to “become involved with European (and Asiatic) conflicts”! We would still be lily-white clean, without blooding our hands with foreign wars!And the results? They would have been that the entire planet would have been divided between two powers: The continents of Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia, together with all of their oil and other natural resources, being controlled by the militant warlike powers of Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy and the Empire of Japan, with their vast armies. And the continents of North and South America being controlled by democratic United States of America. An isolationist United States that had, in 1939, an army of about 180,000 which ranked 19th in the world, behind that of Portugal! And which wanted nothing to do with fighting a war with any foreign nation!What would the balance of power been then? How long could that have lasted? How long could Democracy have remained alive and viable under those circumstances?Is this what the author wanted? To be sure, we would have stayed out of war. At least until we could no longer even hope of winning a war! But at what price? Think about it a while! Sometimes one does not have a choice between Good and Evil. Sometimes the choice is only between Bad and Less Bad. Which would the author have chosen?","2 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00U9SEGJY%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_arp_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26csrfT%3DhJoAv11L%252FR71iyULmBeUFENYnEon1E78I6kuROiglR%252F%252FAAAAAGQvx1YAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR3VAT7S6AQJSIX&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hJoAv11L%2FR71iyULmBeUFENYnEon1E78I6kuROiglR%2F%2FAAAAAGQvx1YAAAAB&reviewId=R3VAT7S6AQJSIX","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
"Daman Collins","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Americas unnecessary missteps in Asia","2017年2月17日 在美国审核","已确认购买","So many misunderstandings. China, Japan, Vietnam, Korea. Educated men mislead by people of self interest. A legacy that continues to this very day. Current arguments about a one China policy, a belligerent North Korea, not mentioned in book but the debate on Okinawa. America has produced some really good experts, John service and John Davies on China, George Kennan on Russia, Archimedes Patti on Vietnam; men whose opinions were mostly dismissed because of their conflict with what this author calls a mirage. I see an arrogant man or men, standing in the door, blinded by oversize egos, refusing to accept or even listen to the other side of the story. Men with preconceived ideas of morality and white washed superiority. East coast elites looking through a glass and seeing countries, cultures and peoples that need to be taught and lead the right way. Of course it's their way and not self determination as defined by Jefferson. The wise men say it's a path to containment of a danger that will save not only them but us. Really!!! Whether it's a Roosevelt or an Acheson or a Dean Rusk, the end result is the same; conflict, spilling of blood, spending of treasure; finally an uneasy co existence where a suspicious mind in the head of a maniac is dangerous. Dominos, containments, us against them; words from the vocabulary of the creators of the neo con Cold War culture. Eisenhower's military industrial complex warning come alive. Acheson even called it an economic policy for the west. ""Korea saved us"" the author tells us Acheson gushed. At the same time, we have yet another warning about special interest groups. The main facilitator of misinformation for this authors work is the China lobby. Working with Americans like Henry Luce of time magazine, propagandizing an American public always seeking to help the down trodden. Putting out stories that were not true, slanted towards building and expanding the mirage. Painting the pictures of hero worship. Over two hundred thousand Americans killed in wars caused by this misreading of the oriental mind. Hundreds of billions of dollars spent building a dream that was not real. A grand illusion, this author says its a China Mirage. Finally, the most disturbing aspect of this story is the christian angle. Missionaries and state side churches saying things that were not true. Example being Chinas people are wanting to convert to the christian faith and become like America, turning back the heathen race. Sure according to this author, some people did convert but the vast majority did not. We're talking a population of 400 million in the 20's 30' and early 40's. People like Pearl Buck writting stories about peasant farmers, likening them to the American farmer during a time of the Great Depression. Her book became a best seller then a movie. The speaking circuit put her in more American minds.  Henry Luce, mentioned earlier, the son of a missionary, founder and head of the notable Time and life magazines empire, doing story after story, cover after cover on the ""christian"" Chaing Kai Skek. No where near accurate but used for the purpose of extracting money from the American government and the gullible christian public. A new China they said over and over again. An illusion, a great Oz behind the curtain moment that lasted for years and that In the end was a Shameful sin of the highest order. What a waste of money, people, energy and above all hope. It could have been much different. The ones that knew the truth were on the inside looking out but the bubble was a one way mirror.  A real good book that gives a series of great events some depth.","7 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00U9SEGJY%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_arp_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26csrfT%3DhGKI9rK2v40gYkDQtTFy5c08%252B8yL86E%252BoFAUjHAopc64AAAAAGQvx1YAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR3OTKWXS5LQ4DC&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hGKI9rK2v40gYkDQtTFy5c08%2B8yL86E%2BoFAUjHAopc64AAAAAGQvx1YAAAAB&reviewId=R3OTKWXS5LQ4DC","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
"M. Liu","3.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Informative, Provocative, but has flaws","2018年1月26日 在美国审核","已确认购买","I enjoyed reading the  colorful descriptions of the two Roosevelt Presidents and the wise men who had influenced their decisions. I learned that the recent serge of  anti-China  pro-Japan sentiments  dated back to the Presidency of Theodore Roosevelt (1901-09) , just  two decades after the signing of the Chinese Exclusion Act. We know that the Roosevelts and many of the most prominent  American families  made their fortune  dealing with  illegal opium trade in China.  Teddy Roosevelt despised China  and was enamored with Japan under Meiji rule, as it was the first Asian nation to become westernized.  Roosevelt secretly  orchestrated a ”Japanese Monroe doctrine” to set up Japan as the  keeper of Asia  to counter  Russia.  When Japan went to war with Russia in 1904  over the control of Korea and China's  northeast  provinces (Manchuria) , Roosevelt acted as a peace broker. affirmed Japanese control, and secretly gave Korea to Japan for which he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.  Subsequently Japan turned around to bite the hand that fed it  and the tide turned . The United States under President Franklin  D. Roosevelt acted heroically  and payed a heavy price to protect China as well as  American  Pacific interests from Japanese aggression.  Bradley went on to show that history kept on repeating itself, and  similar misjudgment of succeeding administrations  had led to the Korean War and Vietnamese War. Let's not forget what US intervention has done to the Middle East  (see: A World in Disarray by Richard Haass 2018). Finally China, after a century of calamities ( foreign invasion ending in colonization, revolutions, Japanese occupation,  a whole scale civil war, ,economical failure, famine , domestic political persecution and international isolation ) had  miraculously risen to the top.  However, a strong China is  unacceptable to Washington. The Pentagon warriors are repeating the mistake of Theodore Roosevelt, that is: militarizing and pitting Japan, a  nation with a long record of war crimes, against China who had never invaded another country in its long history.  Millions of Chinese, Japanese, Koreans and Vietnamese had died as the result of policy failures during the  past century. In the present nuclear age, another mistake could mean the end of civilization.  Overall, I  appreciate Bradley's rare inside look and cynical criticism of  world leaders, but I  disagree with his assessment of Chiang Kai-shek which is based solely on Stilwell's viewpoint.  Most Chinese persons I know , including some Communists, consider  Chiang a true patriot.  As successor to Sun Yat-sen,  founder of  Republic of China , Chiang  led the revolutionary army on a victorious Northern Expedition  to unite a China torn by warlords.  Chiang was not ignorant, having had a classical Chinese education and had studied  at the Imperial Japanese Military  Academy  in Tokyo. Sent by Sun to Moscow to study the Soviet political and military systems ,Chiang quickly realized  that the Soviet model of government was not good for China , a view  which Chinese Communists later recognized as well.  Chiang  was a ruthless dictator and warmonger, but not  on the  level of Hitler or the Japanese mad dogs. Chiang's downfall was caused by : (1) Japanese invasion, (2) his obsession to eliminate communism at all cost and  (3) a chaotic and corrupt system he inherited.  Having learned a bitter lesson from his failure on the China mainland,  Chiang and his son/heir Chiang Ching-kuo, did serious reforms  to eliminate corruption and to improve the livelihood of people on Taiwan.  With American aid and Chinese assets : money taken  from the mainland (including my father's retirement  pension) and manpower ( educators, scientists, industrialists , financiers and  politicians )who followed Chiang to Taiwan,  the KMT had accomplished  the "" Taiwan Miracle.”  They  fed a large army and refugee (1.2 million versus 6.2 million local population), educated the young , myself included, achieved land reform , industrialization , economic boom and  made Taiwan one of Four Asian Tigers.(See : The Generalissimo: Chiang Kai-shek and the struggle for modern China. by Jay Taylor 2011).H.

"Geo","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Challenges many beliefs","2015年4月25日 在美国审核","已确认购买","Cordell Hull is shown to be very careful,  but he missed a meeting of the minds with his Japanese counterpart. The Japanese showed bad judgement In posting an ambassador to the United States who was not fluent in English. All of this is happening at a time when neither the US nor Japan could risk a misinterpretation of the other's message. On the other hand, China's Nationalists were marketing wizards. They were educated in the best US Universities and knew how to use the Christianity card to their advantage. The prize for the American Christians was both the  Americanization and the conversion of China, notwithstanding the existence of the Exclusion Act! The problem was the people who were responsible for executing in China were kleptomaniacs, stealing from the U.S and exploiting their own people. However, their pitch was so captivating, they convinced both the religious and political elite to support their cause, even though there were strong contrary head-winds .So what! It was a major factor in Japan's decision to attack Pearl Harbor. The Chinese lobby made an embargo of oil and the freezing of assets viable. You have to read the book to see how it was cleverly done. Hint: the President was away meeting Churchill, the Secretary of State on vacation and three very smart Ivy League hires used the power vacuum to implement the restrictions. When the decision-makers returned, they faced a fait accompli which they couldn't reverse since Japan, as a result of it's outrageous conduct in China, lost the moral high ground.The book unfurled an intricate web of money and power. Unfortunately,  the Nationalists were using other people's money (U.S)  to amass their power. So successful were they at their game, the U.S became blind to any counterpoint. This becomes a tragedy in history leading the U.S to bet the house on the wrong horse. There were repeated overtures by Mao to befriend the U.S but because of this powerful influence, all initiatives were rebuffed. This lead to almost thirty years of hostile relations between the U.S and China. The rhetorical question is: if we had normal relations with China, could the wars in Korea and Vietnam have been avoided?Finally, the reader will be surprised to learn the identity of some of the patrician families whose fortune was at least partially attributive to the opium business.  These dope dealers diversified their ill-gotten gains into legitimate businesses which provided the foundation for their prestige in American society.  I recommend The China Mirage because it gives a credible  Asian historical perspective to many contemporary events in today's world of  politics.","29 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00U9SEGJY%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_arp_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26csrfT%3DhD6ohgcEEyDtbrK7N4b12CMF1fsMKeurT3inXFIZWOLbAAAAAGQvx1YAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR35A2K6VK2F2MY&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hD6ohgcEEyDtbrK7N4b12CMF1fsMKeurT3inXFIZWOLbAAAAAGQvx1YAAAAB&reviewId=R35A2K6VK2F2MY","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
"Chris P","4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Interesting Perspective on the ""Good War""","2018年8月20日 在美国审核","已确认购买","This book adds some very valuable perspective. My father was not overly religious, but like many of the Greatest Generation, he was taken in by Life Magazine and thought highly of Chiang Kai-Shek, whom publisher Henry Luce apparently went out of his way to portray as the pro-Western Christian good guy.With Imperial Cruise, Bradley described America's early dealings with Japan from Commodore Perry through TR's handing over Korea (in exchange for their staying out of the Philippines). Mirage starts with the opium trade that made the Roosevelts rich to start with. It then shows how U.S.-educated Chinese powerplayers, over decades, learned to leverage overseas support from wishful evangelicals to build their power base. When the interwar years interrupt Chiang's losing battle with Mao Tse Tung, we see a full court press by Chiang, Madame Kai-Shek, and allies in Washington and New York to steer the U.S. into fighting Japan for them.I don't fully agree with Bradley's premise that we could have avoided the Pacific War, unless one imagines us not building up the Japanese empire with U.S. steel and oil in the first place. And once re-elected, FDR was willing to go further to support the Nationalists, at least to buy time if nothing else.But as today's generations have seen, from Gulf War II to Trump, not everyone in D.C. follows the president's playbook. Some under FDR agreed with him that a total embargo of Japan risked war; others did not. With cunning, and thanks to the chief being away at the wrong time, the latter camp (chiefly Stimson, ultimately Dean Acheson) conducted their own foreign policy and at least managed to speed history up. This is perhaps Bradley's greatest contribution.I agree that he sounds too sympathetic to the clever Mao, whom he admits could be as barbaric with his own people as Chiang. An informal, often snarky tone doesn't help him from coming across as overly liberal. Through three books though, I've found the revelations worth Bradley's take on things. His is not the final historical word, but it's mostly a positive addition to the puzzle.","25 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00U9SEGJY%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_arp_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26csrfT%3DhMdl%252BFUp8iVB%252BdT2PCpCXDL%252B4axTFsmk7uLphhfD%252Fie1AAAAAGQvx1YAAAAB%26reviewId%3DRQU8ZTYAFV9OH&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hMdl%2BFUp8iVB%2BdT2PCpCXDL%2B4axTFsmk7uLphhfD%2Fie1AAAAAGQvx1YAAAAB&reviewId=RQU8ZTYAFV9OH","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
"John Bell","4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","A well written analysis on our awful foreign policy vis à vis Asia","2015年6月29日 在美国审核","已确认购买","First, regarding the negative reviews on this book … The majority of Americans are so spoon-fed by their 'education' a/o liturgy as to fossilize those ‘teachings’ into fixed truths … when better information subsequently appears they dig in their heels refusing to allow these truths to see the light of day.This book destroys many shibboleths — that the 2 Roosevelt’s and Truman were some of our greatest presidents, that all our wars were necessary and justified, that errors of governance were not on our accord but were monkey-wrenched by others (Communists, Chinks etc), that the USA is the greatest nation on earth and its corollary — all other nations are criminally corrupt a/o inept, that all policies are based on “best for state” data and never on favoritism, prejudice, ax grinding, vendetta etc. and that the USA has never been a narcotraffcker  of opium a/o heroin.Bradley’s text does an outstanding job deconstructing these myths and illuminating how these errors have resulted in the unjustified deaths of millions, squandered > $10 trillion from our Treasury and poisoned the well for future administrations.  Sadly, nothing has been learned because George Santayana had it right — those who do not know history are condemned to repeat it.  Look — even our current president, the Kenyan squatter in the White House, remains as clueless as the prior apparatchiks in his position.  Or, to borrow a line from Talleyrand RE Obama … “he has learned nothing and forgotten nothing.”Why not 5-star review?  This book makes a common error stating that North Korea invaded South Korea in 1950 starting the Korean War whereas, in fact, the converse is the truth.  For example, RKO President Syngman Rhee subsequently admitted that South Korea invaded North Korea during an August 1954 interview with US News and World Report.

"Kindle Customer","3.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","The Asian mystery","2015年6月28日 在美国审核","已确认购买","This book attacks American foreign policy in East Asia, focusing on relationships between the Roosevelts and Japan and China.  The central premise is that much of the conflict between the US and these nations could have been avoided by more astute foreign policies.  The timing of the book is interesting, given the recent Roosevelt hagiography on PBS by Ken Burns.  But that is probably a coincidence.There is little that is conceptually new in this book, but it contains much detail that was new, and sometimes exhausting, to me.  How many times do you have to state the oft-reported observation that Chiang Kai-Shek and his wife were manipulators and crooks?  The book is very uneven, focusing too much on the China Lobby and Chiang and paying too little attention to others who played important roles in these dramas, such as Mao, the Japanese leaders, Ho Chi Minh, Korea’s leaders and others.To me, the conclusions reached by the author seem a stretch.  Certainly, events would have played out differently had the American leaders, beginning with the Roosevelts, been less gullible.  Maybe my father would not have died in the South Pacific.  But that is all speculation.Once opened by Perry, Japan seemed destined to follow a European model of colonialism, as did every “emerging” nation of that era.  The relationship between Teddy and the Japanese was only a side show.  China was the “weak man” of Asia, being picked apart by everyone else, much as the Ottoman Empire before WWI.  That made them an obvious target for Japan.  Given its history, China could not rise until a strong leader could connect with its vast population, enter Mao, only delayed by Chiang, just another warlord.  And Mao, an avowed Communist regardless of his postulations, would always have been opposed by American businessmen.  The postwar mistakes of American “statesmen” can just as easily be blamed on the failure to recognize anti-colonialism as the dominant driving force.  This misjudgment, along with the pathological fear of American presidents of being considered “weak”, sent us spiraling into avoidable conflicts in Korea and Viet Nam.  Unfortunately, these problems are being perpetuated, with the Middle East being the new battleground.I would draw three different conclusions from the details so vividly described in this book.  First, America should not let its foreign policies be dominated by Christians, Ivy League elitists or businessmen; they all have personal agendas.  Second, personal diplomacy by Presidents should be avoided; the Roosevelts are not the only ones who have been gulled.  One can cite the Saudis and Bushes and Netanyahu as current problems.  Third, one should always respect the opinion of real experts, whether diplomats or scientists, when deciding important national issues.Although I believe this book is significantly flawed, it does provide a lot of interesting information about a critical period in American history, plus lessons that we should have learned, but did not.","56 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00U9SEGJY%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhMcASeWjz55ZS0rIEkC5EF84XH3zf0iPG%252Bb4aAA%252FjjJAAAAAAGQvx2sAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR3F83PY66V0GHQ&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hMcASeWjz55ZS0rIEkC5EF84XH3zf0iPG%2Bb4aAA%2FjjJAAAAAAGQvx2sAAAAB&reviewId=R3F83PY66V0GHQ","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
"Doctor Ed","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","For 150 years the story of our government's policy toward China has been a hoax. This is a must read.","2017年1月1日 在美国审核","已确认购买","James Bradley has written one of the most compelling stories of history that makes one rethink the entire approach of the U.S. foreign policy toward Asia since the days of the Opium Wars.  He convincingly, although I'm sure controversially to many, describes how for decades we favored the Japanese over the Chinese, supported corruption for years in China and then by the decisions of a few of the ""wisest"" men in government and while FDR was out of the country, changed foreign policy toward Japan that may have led to the attack on Pearl Harbor. He continues the history through how we fought in Korea and how it could have been avoided to how we got into Viet Nam, again a conflict that was unnecessary. If he did not support every statement in great detail, one could easily read this book as one great conspiracy theory, but it is difficult to refute the history that he explores.  If you have any interest in history and current events and want to have a much better understanding of how our relationship with China and Southeast Asia developed and how it could have been much different, I would strongly encourage you to read this book.Bradley is a good writer and this is by no means a dry read but if I were the editor there are sections of the book I would have shortened and others could have been expanded.  This is one book where I did not want it to end.  There is so much to tell and I hope Mr. Bradley will write a sequel to bring us up to today.  As I write, we are in the transition period of a new administration which could have profound effects on our foreign policy.  Without understanding where we have been and the mistakes we have made as a country in our policies toward Southeast Asia, it is unlikely that our new relationships with this important area of the world will be anything but destructive and lead to further hostility and economic strife.","32 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00U9SEGJY%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhB89sYux5CAvnY03eClhOl1Za%252FgJea3byRn0SK%252F062J4AAAAAGQvx2sAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR22EDRV7ZF2HQK&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hB89sYux5CAvnY03eClhOl1Za%2FgJea3byRn0SK%2F062J4AAAAAGQvx2sAAAAB&reviewId=R22EDRV7ZF2HQK","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
"Michelle W","4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","A Mirage for Over 150 Years?","2020年5月31日 在美国审核","已确认购买","James Bradley, the son of a soldier in the Pacific War, wanted to trace the cause of this devastating war, which killed more than 41,000 soldiers and injured more than 145,000. In his description, the war originated from a China Mirage -Americans imagined that they could help godless China transform into a Christian democracy. Consequently, their supply of resources to China and reduced the oil supply to Japan triggered the attack on Pearl Harbor, which was the prelude to the Pacific War.Whether knowing rather than imaging China would develop a different course for the Pacific War is debatable. Still, Bradley's research on the relationship between China and America during the first half of 20's century revealed wealthy official and anecdote materials for anyone who is interested in China's contemporary history and why China has become present China, to read and think.History is impossible to assume. It took more than 60 years to repeal the Chinese Exclusion Act, and another 60 years have passed since then. Many well-educated ""Chinese Nobel farmers"" have become Citizens of the United States.

"Thomas L. Booker","4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","The Seduction of the USA","2017年5月5日 在美国审核","已确认购买","It is a pity that history is not taught from the standpoint of dynamics between societies, and nations, actions and consequences that play out over centuries.This is a little-known tale of the  exploitation of China by certain factions of American traders who rode the coattails of British imperialists who, for purely monetary reasons, initiated the opium trade.  Actually the trade began as a simple smuggling operation on a vast scale, until what there was of the Chinese monarchy rebelled, and were repulsed by military action.  There is mention of the opium wars during the late 19th century, but the details have not routinely been explained as well as they are in this book.  The opium wars are only an opening.What is described in this book is the seduction of influential Americans by factions in China's nationalist movement.

"Richard King","3.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","America is still trying to interfere with China","2017年3月12日 在美国审核","已确认购买","Mr. Bradley shed light on aspects of American involvement in Asia and particularly China from American perspective that I knew something about but not to the degree which he described. For that I am very grateful. America’s continuing interference in China is today’s greatest challenge between China and America. As a Chinese-American I am concerned. In the days of Roosevelts the attempt was both to Christianize and Americanize China as Mr. Bradley said. Even today America accuses China of religious persecution stating that Christians are forced to practice their religion underground. China is not a Christian nation. It has its own religion which is a combination of Buddhism, Confucian philosophy and ancestral worship. The history of Christian involvement in China coinciding with military invasion is still too raw in China.It does not surprise me that FDR’s maternal grandfather Warren Delano made his fortune not just trading tea and porcelain but mostly in opium. He left FDR’s mother a fortune equivalent in value to a billion in today’s term. You could say he was the El Chapo of his days. But the Brits were far worse. They invaded China twice in the so called Opium Wars.One thing I gave FDR credit was, unlike the racist Churchill, he wanted China to be one of the major powers after WWII. Churchill and other European countries wanted to regain their former colonies and continue to enslave Asians. While Korea gained its independence from Japan it was immediately divided by big powers to this day. Philippines did not gain its independence until 1946 with a series of puppets. Malaya was not freed until 1957. And Hong Kong was only returned to China in 1997. France which collaborated with the Japanese tried to overthrow the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Its first president Ho Chi Minh was supported by OSS when he was fighting the Japanese. France then installed another puppet and ultimately led to the costly Vietnam War.A few complaints: The author should correct the fact that Charlie Soong actually had three daughters and three sons, not one. I should know as I worked with T.V. Soong’s son in law. This is a minor point. What is more troublesome is his mistake stating that the Japanese sneak attack on the Russian Pacific Fleet took place in Korea. It was at Port Arthur, in present day Dalian, in China. Russians and Japanese fought on Chinese land with Chinese civilians suffered the consequences.","111 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00U9SEGJY%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhFLtzPM1%252ByiPqezXQzjsIr5XwWmKl%252FPoZO3bNY%252FbTC6dAAAAAGQvx2sAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR3LE4I9ZIKGTL8&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hFLtzPM1%2ByiPqezXQzjsIr5XwWmKl%2FPoZO3bNY%2FbTC6dAAAAAGQvx2sAAAAB&reviewId=R3LE4I9ZIKGTL8","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
"Nona","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","When History is Hidden, We All Lose","2015年4月25日 在美国审核","已确认购买","Bradley has written a fascinating history of America’s perceptions of China.  To do that, he has to explain Chinese history and compare that history to America’s perception of China. Bradley points out the insanity of our American recognition of Taiwan as “China,” when the real China has 1.3 billion people and 9.6 million square kilometers of land, while Taiwan has only 23 million people and 36 thousand square miles of territory. Bradley explains how we arrived at this skewed perception of the number 2 superpower, and gives us fascinating details on the way.  Sure I have read of the China trade and China Clipper ships, but I ignorantly thought people made fortunes in porcelain and silks.  Sure I knew there were opium wars and an Open Door Policy, but I never put together a timeline or really understood the issues.  Bradly documents how England and the US fought to sell opium to China and how the profits of those drug sales were the foundation of many American fortunes and even more misconceptions.  Bradley explains how Chinese politicians managed American perceptions and how smart American politicians playing to a domestic audience missed multiple opportunities to create real alliances and act in both countries self-interest. If only we had realized these facts 50 years ago.  The China Mirage is a fascinating book because it explains what I never understood-the reasons why the US considered a little island to be the real China for 30 years while the continental China was ignored as a type of Russian vassal state.  Unlike many histories, The China Mirage never bores and always enlightens.  It is a fascinating and entertaining read.  I highly recommend it.","71 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00U9SEGJY%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhOEHMJlD7wibwyOMHRwJGh%252B4fBKtTdRCI7MWUvPEMGNCAAAAAGQvx2sAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR32GJ877EQLGFE&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hOEHMJlD7wibwyOMHRwJGh%2B4fBKtTdRCI7MWUvPEMGNCAAAAAGQvx2sAAAAB&reviewId=R32GJ877EQLGFE","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

We all become authorities after we find ourselves in a difficult quagmire, people seem to have trouble understanding nothing happens in a vacuum. The attack on pearl Harbor is a perfect example, usually as American History was taught chronologically we came to Pearl Harbor at the rush ending of a school year, it was made to seem as if the Japanese woke up 1 morning and decided to attack . The little we were told of Korea was it was the 1 clear war breaking the Brian Kellogg pact because U.N. observers were on the scene when the North invaded the South. What wasn't covered from the Pentagon papers was Roosevelt's promise to Ho Chi Minh of a independent Vietnam in exchange f ok r Vietnam' s support against the Japanese. This book and The Coldest Winter make excellent companion pieces, they also serve as a tutorial to conducting foreign policy in the middle east where I fear people are shouting solutions without any real knowledge of the history of the people and the area. Last thought this book also speaks of a world when the U.S. did not have the military industrial Complex of today, we have stepped into a predicament of our own making which I fear there is no turning back.","1 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00U9SEGJY%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhHWpTsFnSe1rHw5roWNc9StA38Y6NKOsMunBMEp8KgK7AAAAAGQvx2sAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR14GUZ1P68I4O&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hHWpTsFnSe1rHw5roWNc9StA38Y6NKOsMunBMEp8KgK7AAAAAGQvx2sAAAAB&reviewId=R14GUZ1P68I4O","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

The focus of the book is how US policy toward China is influenced by our religious Judeo Christian ethic. Bradley spends considerable time in the book  describing  the how our China policy  was influenced by our desire  to Christianize  the heathen.  Pearl Buck  and Luce from Time magazine, had a profound effect on the way the Chinese were portrayed in the thirties to the fifties. I was completely unaware of the so-called China lobby that had such a strong influence in Washington. I think Bradley may have taken a bit too long on the role that FDR played in shaping China policy. I felt that the book got a bit stuck in the World War 2 era. We didn't understand the Chinese then... spent little time in the country... and had few diplomats that I actually knew the real China. AN area in which I felt the book was lacking, was was that there were few policy prescriptions for dealing with modern China. I didn't come away from the book feeling I had any idea of how we should approach the modern behemoth that China has become today. I'm not sure how our past China policy should influence the direction of our current political discourse.","3 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00U9SEGJY%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhOSU0ytUQlDG3j%252B3xV0LJtQWhuF6K0m%252By1uIbxy%252FLFfoAAAAAGQvx2sAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR1AM0K2Q8GP729&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hOSU0ytUQlDG3j%2B3xV0LJtQWhuF6K0m%2By1uIbxy%2FLFfoAAAAAGQvx2sAAAAB&reviewId=R1AM0K2Q8GP729","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
"Armchair Historian","1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Deliberate Leftist lies?","2022年7月13日 在美国审核","已确认购买","The notion that Dean Acheson of his own volition and against the president's wishes (While FDR was out of town meeting with Churchill on the Prince of Wales) cut of all oil shipments to Japan, knowingly provoking the Japanese into starting the Pacific war would be laughable if it wasn't such a blatant lie in order to rehabilitate FDR's determination to force the Japanese to attack us. Can anyone imagine a more irresponsible act by a bureaucrat??? If Acheson had done anything remotely this devious and dis-loyal to his employer, you would expect subsequent political leaders to shun him as the worst example of a loose cannon...but no, he went on to be Truman's secretary of state and ultimately worked closely with both JFK and LBJ (Not to mention that FDR kept Acheson around afterwards and even promoted him.) Kennedy actually called Acheson to the White House to advise him on the Cuban missile crisis. (I can just imagine the conversation JFK had with his brother, ""Hey Bobby, lets get that guy Acheson in here to give us advice on this life or death situation with Russia...you know, the guy who single handidly started the Pacific war with Japan while FDR was out of town..."") Bradley also spins the fanciful tale that Mao and the Chinese communists were benevolent, warm and cuddly big-brothers, a sort of  Marxist Meals-On-Wheels who treated the Chinese people with kindness and benevolence, rather than being the enormous mass-murderers history has proven them to be. The China Mirage is a mirage alright - from a distance it seems like history but is nothing more than an enormous lie.","1 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00U9SEGJY%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhIVRfAOBuN3ZT0m112ciU0fAOkU7uGRbhTJx5diwqUOvAAAAAGQvx2sAAAAB%26reviewId%3DRGETKANVH8LPQ&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hIVRfAOBuN3ZT0m112ciU0fAOkU7uGRbhTJx5diwqUOvAAAAAGQvx2sAAAAB&reviewId=RGETKANVH8LPQ","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

But what may surprise most of us is that Presidents Teddy Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt, Eisenhower, and Johnson were similarly misled into policies that resulted in wars with Japan, Korea, and Viet Nam that did not have to happen. They misread communications and were totally misled into allying with Chang instead of Mao and Diem instead of Minh. Loaded information came from a college friend of Teddy who became envoy Meiji, China missionaries, China propagandists, and Time magazine. This book tells the history of the roots of our woe begotten relations with Japan, then China, then Korea, then Viet Nam. How the China Lobby in our country bamboozled our people, our government, and all but a few outcaste military, ambassadors, and intelligence officers. It explains how foreign policy may arise from the secret manipulations of presidents behind the backs of experienced officers of State and Defense. By analogy it calls attention to the dangers of foreign interested lobbyists like the AIPAC, and those currently collecting favors from presidential hopefuls like the Clintons; and it warns of the catastrophes that can result from opinion based news like Fox. You may not need to read this book, but our presidents certainly do.","13 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00U9SEGJY%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhGt5fB3xjMupcJn6tQjaOUyDB%252FNXXTp%252BiO%252FrLmcctAxOAAAAAGQvx2sAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR1ZEOGLG5AJN5S&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hGt5fB3xjMupcJn6tQjaOUyDB%2FNXXTp%2BiO%2FrLmcctAxOAAAAAGQvx2sAAAAB&reviewId=R1ZEOGLG5AJN5S","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

But we do not sit near the dance that discloses the day's passing to the mind of the father, nor do we look with open eyes even upon the days that are our own. So when reading of an appearance concerning China, one whose wisps wound through everything from the foreign policy of the United States to the classroom of the little boy I once was, there arose in me a sense of relief, a kind of glad fulfillment. The story of the past, repeated like a drum is beaten when growing up, felt incomplete, ever unfinished, and the ground of many unanswered questions. So it is refreshing to be introduced to the humanity of heroes and our penchant for hiding the truth under the shadow of our desires. I would only warn that if reading of what we have been and done does not stimulate closer attention to what we are and do today, James Bradley's book is a tragic tale of thirst, being lost, and dying in the desert.","2 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00U9SEGJY%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhE%252BSFd5YjrT05uj6sV6HS%252F2PW8PZiFalGBkuXUM8M7lcAAAAAGQvx2wAAAAB%26reviewId%3DRTQOGYUG0QRAQ&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hE%2BSFd5YjrT05uj6sV6HS%2F2PW8PZiFalGBkuXUM8M7lcAAAAAGQvx2wAAAAB&reviewId=RTQOGYUG0QRAQ","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
"Randy","2.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","which has many good points of history","2017年1月29日 在美国审核","已确认购买","I just finished his earlier book The Imperial Cruise & started on this book, which has many good points of history. My problem is that I'm halfway thru the book & Bradley seems not to have one good thing to say about the Chiangs or Soongs & nothing but praise for Mao. You get engrossed in the story so his slant is very subtle. He enumerates every (supposed) flaw of the  Chiangs & Soongs but Mao is described as having ""extraordinary courage"" & ""with a stroke of genius"" and in general, as a great friend of the noble peasants. But some estimates put Mao's genocide of his beloved peasants at 200 million. Every depiction by Bradley of Mao shows his good treatment of the people & every depiction of Chiang kai-shek is of mistreatment.It seems a dose of truth could be seen by comparing life in Taiwan vs pre-Westernized era of China (before Nixon). Life for Taiwanese was/is much better than those of Mainland China. Author also says Mayling was hypocritical in pushing citizens to stop smoking--while privately she was a chain-smoking fiend. That's possible but seems unlikely considering her lifelong youthful appearance, and the fact  she lived to be a 106. It's a small detail but challenges the author's credibility. His constant praise of Mao & disdain of Chiang seems to show a virulent leftist slant.I've been studying WWI & II for the past 2.5 years & have discovered that so much of American history is watered down nonsense. The appeal of Bradley's book to me was the promise of being ""hidden history,"" which is where the greater truth of history is found. He does give some of that, but its not the deeper layer of truth I hoped for. And praise of Mao is crazy myth making, no doubt many in America's increasingly socialist population will be taken in by that.","13 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00U9SEGJY%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhINGAu1a25bj3qwYD5zIJkoyNbZ91H6HPUCuYnS2gdqgAAAAAGQvx2wAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR36PAIY173AJN5&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hINGAu1a25bj3qwYD5zIJkoyNbZ91H6HPUCuYnS2gdqgAAAAAGQvx2wAAAAB&reviewId=R36PAIY173AJN5","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
"Michael Griswold","3.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","The China That Blinds","2016年12月30日 在美国审核","已确认购买","James Bradley wrote one of my favorite books in Flags of Our Fathers, so I’ve always had it in mind to read his other works when time allowed. In the China Mirage, Bradley argues that the Roosevelt's (Teddy and FDR most prominently) had a special relationship and feeling towards China, which is based on false notions of greed, imperialism, and racism. This relationship and feeling had a significant influence on US policy making for about a 40 year period, even when evidence suggested the foolishness of such policy.This one did not grab me in the way that the highly personal Flags of Our Fathers did because that book was highly intimate and allowed me as a reader to get invested. Furthermore, the use of nicknames suggested a certain friendliness that probably should not exist between an author and the subject particularly when one makes the type of claims, which Bradley makes.But what of the actual claims? It is possible that the United States and China have a special relationship. As a country, we have special relationships with others (Israel, Great Britain), but this book seems to argue that without the Roosevelt's, US policy in China during the period would have been different. I’m not sure there would have been a ton of difference. America has often believed “The enemy of my enemy is my friend” and aided those who were fighting our enemies.Call it an inconclusive case.","2 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00U9SEGJY%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhHbOGN9NChD3NYWTWP6YSsu1ZkZpOI%252B%252Fd1688EUftA4aAAAAAGQvx2wAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR1OKJY1K26OCN4&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hHbOGN9NChD3NYWTWP6YSsu1ZkZpOI%2B%2Fd1688EUftA4aAAAAAGQvx2wAAAAB&reviewId=R1OKJY1K26OCN4","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

Facts unknown or never released come to light that shed an entirely different view of Chaing Kai Shek's China and how the US got taken to the cleaners.  The false narrative Americans believed and the missed opportunities we ignored because of paranoia about Communism.  We talk about other country's teaching of history missing sensitive issues.  Here's a book that should be part of American history.  Previously, only glimpses and partial insight gave hints of mistakes and misguided directions we took.  Bradley points out 'what might have been' had our leaders been more astute about China, her history her politics, and her leaders.  Are we again, headed along the same path?  Are war and aggression embedded in our DNA?  We seem to go from one extreme to another and can't seem to take the middle path.","报告","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00U9SEGJY%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhLsGtckOG2WPteEqeVnal6HMIdAoFVwPxyAbvrjq2lvXAAAAAGQvx2wAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR3ELNPJYVNA4OA&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","显示条评论","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hLsGtckOG2WPteEqeVnal6HMIdAoFVwPxyAbvrjq2lvXAAAAAGQvx2wAAAAB&reviewId=R3ELNPJYVNA4OA","","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

I'm a life long Republican so I suppose my negative view of FDR can be discounted by some. How he ever got to be viewed at one of the country's greatest presidents is beyond me.

I do believe though, and some observers are correct that communists play the political game very well, that had TR not enabled the Japanese to the detriment of other Asian nations, and FDR hadn't been conducting his own shadow diplomacy...perhaps we could have avoided three wars (WWII, Korea, VN) and our relationship with China could be far different and more manageable today.","5 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00U9SEGJY%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhLoLTiX9fPckYfxb7XRF8XnXbQvqvjSPGcTGwAUQ3GQvAAAAAGQvx20AAAAB%26reviewId%3DR3EI7GNPDRJT1H&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hLoLTiX9fPckYfxb7XRF8XnXbQvqvjSPGcTGwAUQ3GQvAAAAAGQvx20AAAAB&reviewId=R3EI7GNPDRJT1H","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

"Bookman Henry","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Intriguing Read","2015年6月4日 在美国审核","已确认购买","James Bradley has written THE must read book for anyone interested in the history of Chinese American politics before, during, and after WWII. While in the military I was stationed in the military on Taiwan during the late 60's and was only aware of the current state of affairs between Mao Zedong and Chiang Kai-shek as reported by the American press. Reading The China Mirage it became clear to me just how that press and the pro Chiang lobby influenced and dominated FDR's asian policy resulting in many bad decisions that would affect our country for decades. As Bradley writes in this book: ""In retrospect, Stilwell's advice could well have resulted in a lasting friendship between China and the United States, saved millions of lives, and adverted the Chinese civil war, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War"". Intriguing.","1 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00U9SEGJY%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhDHWM7JVNwe4sE6iylMwd%252BB24mjg7jIykVjdVrp3sHIwAAAAAGQvx20AAAAB%26reviewId%3DR1IBDELTY8U2SL&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hDHWM7JVNwe4sE6iylMwd%2BB24mjg7jIykVjdVrp3sHIwAAAAAGQvx20AAAAB&reviewId=R1IBDELTY8U2SL","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

The incompetency of western diplomacy and meddling was not surprising--FDR was even a bigger bungler than I had assumed. I take issue with the author on a few important aspects. He seems rather naive in thinking that just because Mao and Ho Chi Min claimed they wanted to cuddle up with the US in favor of the USSR doesnt mean they were sincere. Communists have always lied to get aid and to placate gullible leaders. If you need proof look at how Stalin played the US all throughout the war and ended up at Yalta getting all of Eastern Europe by telling FDR that his intentions were benign. I have been to Viet Nam and heard the stories of murder and starvation after the Communists took over-most people hated the regimeOnce they saw what it really stood for. Not the promise of nationalism but brutal dictatorship. Chiang kai-shekWas a flawed leader but he built a prosperous and proud country in Taiwan (having personally been there recently).The author is caught up in the Leftist hatred of anybody that opposed Communism and ignoring that recent KGB and Venona documents prove that there were many Communist agents and sympathizers in the FDR administration ie. Hopkins, White, Currie, Hess and many more. Read the book byRomerstein and Stanton for more details.The Communists killed and enslaved millions but the author get more angry at McCarthy?

Since the beginning of our relationship with China, the US has been misinformed by those in power and those who put greed first.

However, Bradley jumps to some false conclusions: e.g., the U.S. prompted the war with Japan by cutting off oil and leaving the Japanese military no option other than to attack  Pearl Harbor, or, that if the U.S had responded favorably to Mao's early approaches to the Roosevelt administration, he would not have gone Communist nor would he have aligned China with the Soviet Union, and finally, that Ho Chi Minh, also spurned by the U.S., turned to Communism for lack of an alternative.These are some myths that churned about in the 60's and 70's.

James espouses a theory without proof that if US supported Mao, that China civil war and Korean War and Vietnam War would not have happened; and that China would not have expansion ambitions.  Well, we are here today and China IS expanding into islands south of Japan and South China Sea, and using their economic muscle to mine the world's minerals. Mr. Bradley is indeed naive in his book as the US was naive at the time. While it is indeed true that the China Lobby conned the US, they were just smart at their game that is now normal occurrence. One thing I thought was ironic was that US wanted to make China a Christian nation and to expand trade, and had a critical role in feeding opium to the Chinese, whereas today China is exporting goods and illicit drugs to the US.

"mean","4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Reality Versus the Narrative","2022年6月22日 在美国审核","","This is some heavy duty stuff. If this book is factual and accurate it paints a very damning portrait of U.S. involvement in Asia. Theodore Roosevelt allowed his administration to be penetrated by the Japanese and he did their bidding during the peace negotiations of the Russo-Japanese War. Teddy betrayed Korea in the process. Should his Nobel Peace prize be rescinded? It's an interesting question to consider. Another revelation, Franklin Delano Roosevelt's family wealth came from Opium smuggling in China. A handful of bungling nitwits in FDR's administration created an oil embargo against the Japanese that was a contributing spark behind the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor. I mean, wow. The levels of stupidity and incompetence here are staggering. Well worth the read.My only gripe is on page 330. Once again I find an author and his proof readers have mixed up the B-29 with the B-52. Come on gang, this Boeing bomber stuff is not that difficult to get right is it?

"Loyd Eskildson","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","American History in the Pacific - Dominated by Enormous Misperceptions","2015年6月11日 在美国审核","","America is the world's largest developed country and China the largest developing country. It is inevitable that they will bump into each other. However, author Bradley believes both nations are massively uninformed about the other. Bradley's book summarizes American errors in Asia, driven by a mirage.China had once been the richest country on earth. Unfortunately, it saw foreign visitors as 'foreign devils,' second-class humans desperate for Chinese knowledge and goods. Then, in the late 17th-century, the English began importing massive quantities of Chinese tea. However, the Chinese wanted few English products and, and thus accumulated great amounts of European wealth. During the 17th-century, China's population tripled from about 100 million to over 300 million.Eventually, the British devised a way to reduce this trade deficit - bribing officials to allow chests of opium from British-ruled India (one million Indian opium farmers) entry into China. Chinese authorities became alarmed at the ensuing epidemic, seized vast stocks of opium and dumped them into the sea, thereby setting the stage for the Opium War. (Britain wanted full compensation for the opium.) The result, China was forced to open five ports to foreign traders and allow a British colony at Hong Kong. By 1850, opium accounted for 15 - 20 percent of England's revenues, and credited by some as essential to Britain's survival. One of the Americans profiting greatly was Warren Delano, grandfather of FDR.Japan built a military-industrial complex in response to Admiral Perry and his demands, and then used that might to conquer China. Previously, Teddy Roosevelt had allowed Japan to acquire Korea as a means of keeping the Russians out.By 1838, American missionaries insisted on the right to be left alone while proselyting Chinese citizens. The 'mirage' referred to in the book's title was that China was 'a great nation whose citizens traditionally regarded Americans as their best friends.' This led the U.S. into needless provocation of Japan (eg. embargo of Japanese steel and oil as a penalty for war with China) that precipitated Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor.  America's #1 author in the 1930s (Pearl Buck), along with its #1 publisher (Henry Luce - Time magazine) contended that if we'd just give a little more money to China it would be Christianized and democratized. Pictures of Chiang Kai-shek reading the Bible, as well as stories of him reading the bible an hour/day helped reinforce those dreams. Mao Zedong popped them.FDR saw that continuing to supply Japan with oil would prevent them from attacking south to acquire other sources. However, while in Canada attending a summit, his deputies sabotaged that directive with a myriad of bureaucratic delays. Roosevelt found out about a month later, then decided not to risk a public relations backlash from resuming oil shipments. That was Sept. of 1941; the China Lobby had convinced most that Japan would never attack the U.S.. Pearl Harbor was attacked by six Japanese aircraft carriers that left port 11/26/1941. Hawaii's commanding Army general and Navy admiral hardly had spoken to each other up to that point.Japan's plan was not to invade the U.S., but simply to prevent its navy from interfering in their quest elsewhere for oil and supplies. Experts have concluded the U.S. made a grave blunder by allowing an issue not vital to its basic interests (China) to become a keystone policy issue; that was aided by a mirage perpetrated by the China Lobby that, with a little aid, Chiang Kai-Shek could push the Japanese out of China. Reality, he did very little - preferring to either steal U.S. funds or hoard the supplies for a civil war with Mao after the Japanese were defeated. Had our support at least continued longer, would have avoided a two-front war for the U.S.; had we not been so scared of Mao (Communist), the author contends there would not have been a Chinese civil war, Korean War, or Vietnam War. (Chiang had been elected by 90 leaders of a single party - bogus claim to representation.)Americans also didn't know the U.S. had violated international law by secretly equipping and supplying a small air force in China to attack Japan. (It never accomplished much.)'Who lost China?' became the big purge post-WWII, resulting in the experienced Asia hands who knew reality being purged out. Hence, we repeated the error vs. Vietnam.","14 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00U9SEGJY%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhFuXsJSvJuJ5fwx66RXf6rHo%252B4ZWYvsPhmFR%252Fg4nwayNAAAAAGQvx4MAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR2IPUUHI0K3HSU&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hFuXsJSvJuJ5fwx66RXf6rHo%2B4ZWYvsPhmFR%2Fg4nwayNAAAAAGQvx4MAAAAB&reviewId=R2IPUUHI0K3HSU","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
"Mark McCandless","4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","A valuable polemic on United States Asia policy in the Twentieth Century","2016年9月26日 在美国审核","","This book is a good read.  It has a fascinating discussion of the China Lobby's methods and influence on American policy in the 1930's - 1960's.  It is not a dispassionate history, however.  He's more like a prosecuting attorney, providing all negative facts about American policy and the Nationalist Chinese government and all positive comments (with the exception of one) about Mao.  He mocks the Noble Chinese Peasant as an advertising gimmick without ever considering that their lives might have nobility to them, especially for what they suffered under Japanese attack and rule. None of the Nationalist military efforts after the fight for Shanghai in 1937 are given any credit for slowing or occupying Japanese military forces, even the forces provided to Stilwell at United States insistence to fight in Burma when the most serious need was in East China to stop the Japanese Ichigo Offensive. And this despite the fact that the bulk of the Japanese army faced and fought the Nationalists forces for the entire eight years of the war-- not Mao, nor the the U.S. nor the British.  My advice is to read another book first, such as Forgotten Ally by Rana Mitter, that tries to fairly portray the Nationalist and Communist and, for that matter the United States and Soviet, contributions to the war in China before taking on this polemic on U.S. foreign policy.Mr. Bradley justifies this one-sided negative appraisal of Chiang and positive one of Mao way back in the notes by saying that Mao won the Mandate of Heaven (rule of China), so he was presenting the case for it and leaving out the rest of what these leaders did.  This is not an historian's approach.  By the same logic, the U.S. won WWII, so every thing we did in the war must have been right--which is the opposite of what he is trying to say about our China policy.Lastly, he argues that the U.S. war in the Pacific would not have happened if we had not cut off Japan's oil supply, and that this would have been a good thing.  That's wild speculation at best.  Japan had invaded Manchuria in 1931, China in 1937, and taken over a portion of Indochina in 1941 before the U.S. cut off the oil supply.  They were an expansionist power.  They knew there were voices in the U.S. advocating the cutoff of oil and they knew their military needed oil to hold what they had, let alone keep expanding.  So an attack to grab Indonesian oil fields was probably only a matter of time, especially with the Netherlands, the owners of Indonesia at the time, under occupation.  If we had not cut the oil supply the date of a Japanese attack on Indonesia would have been delayed and there's a somewhat greater chance it may not have included an attack on Pearl Harbor.  But the net result is that Japan would have become a stronger, still very militaristic power, and would likely have defeated the Chinese.  The Philippines astride their shipping routes to the oil fields would have eventually brought war with the United States, but at greater advantage to Japan.  We would have had to face them with their army not pre-occupied in China, and having built up more oil supplies and a larger, better trained and staffed navy.  Regardless of war with the U.S. or not, the U.S. would not have been driven into the war as early as it was, so would not have had it's forces trained and armed as soon as it did, making victory in Europe more difficult.  Keeping out of wars is normally a good thing (Vietnam and Iraq come to mind), but sometimes the alternative can be a worse later war, as Britain and France discovered at Munich.His fact-chewing could have been improved-- he has B-52's attacking Japan in 1945 (p320).  These planes, of course, were B-29's.So, with all these caveats, why is this still a book worth reading?  Because it provides an understanding how American policy can be manipulated by foreign countries.  You could write as thick a book on British efforts in both World Wars to get the U.S. into the war.  This was presented as especially true in the absence of good intelligence and familiarity through the kind of contact that immigration provides.  Also, it presents a clear alternative way to view U.S. relations with Asia with which to balance the ways we've looked at them in the past.","2 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00U9SEGJY%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhPcDF2JNk7jBiocgotw9E8MBiJslNY3bGmAbOfR2yjPKAAAAAGQvx4MAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR1L22ANFO2ZI5T&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hPcDF2JNk7jBiocgotw9E8MBiJslNY3bGmAbOfR2yjPKAAAAAGQvx4MAAAAB&reviewId=R1L22ANFO2ZI5T","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

"PatrickthePilot","4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Very good read -- but left many unanswered questions","2020年7月16日 在美国审核","","Overall, this book is worth reading.  I have read everything James Bradley has written and if you've read anything by him you'll enjoy his consistent writing style in ""The China Mirage"".  He is able to capture characters, circumstances, and events in a way that turns history into page-turning action.  This book covered U.S. interactions with China from Teddy Roosevelt to Franklin Roosevelt to Harry Truman, explaining how our misperception of what we thought first Japan (as described in Bradley's book, ""Imperial Cruise"") and then China should be and not necessarily what they were.  His descriptions of the China Lobby, the limited interaction of the average American with anyone from Southeast Asia, and the personalities that sold us a China that did not exist kept the pages turning and make it worth the read.However, I did have a couple of significant issues with what I read.  First, the book did an excellent job of describing our interactions with China in the early 20th century, but then made a giant leap in the end to blame both the Korean and Vietnam Wars on our early misinterpretations of China.  While the logic is credible, the book fell short explaining the specific events in China that led to those future wars with significant writing ending the China discussion at the end of World War II.  I don't feel like the explanation was wrong, it was just lacking.Secondly, throughout the book Bradley painted Mao Zedong in such a brilliant light, and Chiang Kai-shek so negatively, which was obvious in their leadership styles and the eventual outcome in China.  What was missing was the fact that while Mao was clearly the better leader, where he was leading the people to wasn't accounted for, as proven by the eventual and current atrocities and failures of the Communist system of government in China.  After a while I found it distracting to continually read about how Mao's more effective leadership was moving the people in a direction that they would eventually regret.  Part of the discussion was intended to show (as restated in the conclusion) that had the U.S. engaged better with Mao, China may have followed a different path.  But the discussion became overstated and tedious without addressing the problem-fraught future of a Communist China.The biggest problem that I had with this book, which was obviously well-researched and well cited, was a somewhat mind-blowing error from a professional author.  On page 330 of the Little, Brown, and Company published version of the book, Bradley describes the firebombing of Tokyo in March of 1945.  Twice on the page Bradley writes that ""B-52s"" based on various Pacific islands were the aircraft that conducted the raids.  Unfortunately, the first Boeing B-52 Stratofortress flight didn't take place until April 1952, just over 7 years after the bombing described.  The primary U.S. heavy bomber in the Pacific during WWII, as any amateur historian should be able to identify, was the Boeing B-29 Superfortress, the same aircraft as the Enola Gay used to drop the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima later in 1945.  With so much other in-depth information in the book, an amateur mistake like that makes the rest of the book a little suspect, and is a direct indictment of the editing begging the question as to whether the entire book went to press a little too early to flush out all of the arguments.With all of those relatively minor concerns aside, I really enjoyed this in-depth analysis of the U.S.' initial modern-day development with China.  The writing style was engaging, the arguments rational, and the details interesting.  I was expecting more of a tie-in from the end of Chiang Kai-Shek's dictatorship to how we got to where we are in U.S.-China relations today.  Instead, Bradley chose to hit the fast-forward button around 1950 from which point I was able to pick up a couple of further arguments requiring me to hit the ""I believe"" button to support the conclusions in the final chapter.  I can see where what Bradley describes in detail throughout the book could have resulted in where we are today, but the book fell short in getting me there.","报告","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00U9SEGJY%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhOqLvN9RR1WEVcJUYzfc0w2fWd4DKK2%252FGEblHLTgPWh5AAAAAGQvx4MAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR3HN3Z5MY0R87J&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","显示条评论","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hOqLvN9RR1WEVcJUYzfc0w2fWd4DKK2%2FGEblHLTgPWh5AAAAAGQvx4MAAAAB&reviewId=R3HN3Z5MY0R87J","","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
"Ian Ruxton","4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Alarming Depths of Misunderstanding Revealed by Expert Author","2015年6月26日 在美国审核","","I have just finished reading this book. Full disclosure: it was kindly sent to me by the author James Bradley, since I translated from Japanese a book by Professor Masayoshi Matsumura titled in English 'Baron Kaneko and the Russo-Japanese War' (also available on amazon, see product link in comment below). He has used the translation in the early part of this book (especially Chapter Three) to help describe the relationship between President Theodore (Teddy) Roosevelt and the Japanese Baron Kaneko, both Harvard graduates. His acknowledgement by the way, both inside and outside the book, has been full and entirely appropriate.I have learnt a great deal from Mr Bradley's latest offering. A lot of it relates to a fundamental misunderstanding over decades by most Americans of China, and especially Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek (known rather appropriately to the British and Harry Truman as 'Cash My Cheque'!) and his arch-rival for the Mandate of Heaven (as the governance of China was traditionally called) Mao Zedong. There were many who contributed to this misunderstanding, and the false assumption that Chiang was the right horse to back, when he was no better than an incompetent warlord in many respects. Meanwhile, repeated overtures from the eventual winner in the power struggle for China, Mao Zedong, were ignored or brushed aside by successive presidents and administrations, until at last Richard Nixon met with him.This book explains exactly how the misunderstanding and 'mirage' of China as a country thirsting for Christianity and US-style democracy came about: it was mainly manufactured by the powerful China Lobby, including a combination of cynical Chinese manipulators and American wishful thinkers such as Henry Luce of 'Time' magazine who put Chiang on the front cover of the magazine no less than seven times. The Christian missionaries sent from America to China since the 19th century also had a major hand in it. Meanwhile the Old China Hands such as John Service who understood China very well - from long experience living there and speaking the language - were brushed and cast aside.Another alarming fact revealed is that Franklin Roosevelt had no idea for about a month that an oil embargo had been placed by Dean Acheson in Roosevelt's absence from Washington DC on Japanese purchases of American oil - which made them desperate enough to attack Pearl Harbor and so begin the disastrous Pacific War. The adjective 'loosey-goosey' which appears in the text barely seems to cover the laxness of Roosevelt's lack of control over his administration!I really like this book, because like Bradley's other books, it is remarkably readable, pulls no punches, and explains complex issues with great clarity and ample supporting evidence. It does not appear to over-simplify anything. As a British reader with little real knowledge of Franklin Roosevelt or his administration, it is hugely informative. If I were to quibble, I should say that an academic-style book really should have a bibliography, since there are so many books referenced. But perhaps this was deemed unnecessary in a book which seems destined to become another bestseller. This is, in short, a highly recommended 'tour de force'!","1 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00U9SEGJY%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhEhqO3VPK0Cw%252BOGnUlO2vCkcQpGJkgG1DpPeSywvr4wNAAAAAGQvx4MAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR1XIQQLE9VGVF2&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hEhqO3VPK0Cw%2BOGnUlO2vCkcQpGJkgG1DpPeSywvr4wNAAAAAGQvx4MAAAAB&reviewId=R1XIQQLE9VGVF2","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
"J. Edmund Kinstle","1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","As much as I enjoyed ""The Imperial Cruise"" for its fresh insights","2015年7月24日 在美国审核","","As much as I enjoyed ""The Imperial Cruise"" for its fresh insights, I cannot say the same about ""The China Mirage.""  Too glib, too facile, too given to sophistry.  The book is caked with quotes taken out of context, and churned into a mashup of a different China Mirage, that if 20th Century American diplomacy would have simply hitched it's foreign policy wagon to Communist Mao instead of Nationalist Chiang Kai-shek the world would have ended up a much rosier place.The China Mirage is historical revisionism in the sense that makes its argument through the process of distorting the historical record by putting Chiang Kai-shek in a less favorable light and elevating Chairman Mao from a ruthless dictator to a benevolent one.  Most everything in the book has the false ring of truth. The book starts out by mentioning how Chiang threw off his first wife in favor of Mayling Soong, but doesn't mention that Mao had 4 different wives.  Later in the book it discusses Chiang's infidelity to Mayling, however it's a matter of historical record that Mao had his own infidelities.  And what is most disappointing about this book is how everything is argued in a vacuum, and left open ended.  For example, if the Wise Men would have leant their wholehearted support to Mao as he rose to power prior to WWII, are we to infer that the Great Leap Forward (death toll upwards of at least 18 million) would never have happened?  Or that the Cultural Revolution, that persecuted millions, would never have occurred?  At the time that President Nixon was glad-handing Mao, little was known about the extent of either of those tragedies.  Are the Wise Men expected to answer for these lives too?The book ignores the political reality that the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912 created a very large political vacuum that was filled with many warlords and bandits of different political stripes that would naturally drift towards the right or left.  Remember, this is a country of over 400 million people.  Civil war was almost certain, although not inevitable.  How could any American foreign policy in China, that supported either the Communists, or the Nationalist, not turned into a much larger Vietnam style quagmire immediately after WWII?Lastly, what the book ignores are the two 800 lb. gorilla's in the room - the Soviet Union, and nuclear weapons.  No post-war treatise on China should overlook how Joseph Stalin, and the USSR, would have felt about the possibility of the United States cozying up to Mao on their southeastern border, nor how the budding nuclear arms race between the United States and the USSR affected decision making.  What's missing is the zeitgeist of that era, and without bringing that into the bigger picture one ends up wearing blinders.US foreign policy was a debacle before, during, and after WWII.  The mistreatment of the China Hands is inexcusable to say the very least.  There is no doubt that if that US foreign policy would have been better attuned to the realities in China that many of the postwar errors could have been avoided or eliminated, with many lives saved in the bargain.  This book could have told that story without all the distortions.Finally, one way to judge if a history book will be truthful and worth reading is to look at the back cover and see if there is any advance praise.  There is no advance praise for The China Mirage on the back of the book.  A far, far better book on the topic is ""China 1945, Mao's Revolution and America's Fateful Choice"" by Richard Bernstein.  Published in 2014, the back cover lists advance praise from seven notable sources.  ""China 1945"" book does what The China Mirage does not.  It takes into account not just Roosevelt's misguided decisions, but Stalin's role on the world stage, and Mao's malevolent behavior.  And it doesn't keep flinging the word ""barbarian"" in your face.","50 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00U9SEGJY%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhHRriWYNUuzeysGaPoD%252FuMs32NdzSGe6nttvpanl%252Fiu%252FAAAAAGQvx4QAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR3VL8QJ79DND8G&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hHRriWYNUuzeysGaPoD%2FuMs32NdzSGe6nttvpanl%2Fiu%2FAAAAAGQvx4QAAAAB&reviewId=R3VL8QJ79DND8G","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

"Hande Z","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Seeing Things as they were","2015年5月17日 在美国审核","","This is an immensely fascinating book about the history of American interest in China from the perspectives of the key men from both countries. It begins with the American interest in getting a good trade deal and the indignation at the haughty stance of the Chinese emperor. From then, America and Britain bullied the Chinese with their superior fire power. This was the time of Warren Delano, the grandfather of President Franklin Roosevelt. Bradley gives a gripping account of how the Roosevelts made their fortune from the China trade. But by the First World War, America lost interest in China briefly until Japan started its dominance as a power in the East.The bulk of the book tells the story of how Chiang Kai Shek and the Soong sisters, one of whom he married, together with his brother-in-law, T V Soong, lost China and fooled America into believing that by supporting Chiang, they had a puppet they could manipulate. America was taken in by a combination of factors – that Chiang and the Soongs were graduates from American universities (Chiang was from Harvard) and became Southern Baptists (an important factor to Christian America – it was fervent in its zeal to spread its Christian religion to the Chinese peasants), Chiang’s dishonesty, his sister-in-law’s cunning, the popularity of Pearl Buck’s book ‘The Good Earth’, America’s ignorance of China and the Chinese, and lastly, America’s own ‘China Lobby’ consisting of top aides of President Roosevelt who believed that Chiang would beat the Japanese and also the communists. Billions of dollars were given to Chiang’s ‘New China’. Bradley does not say so, but questions arise as to how much of that went to the Chiang and Soong families who continued to own properties in Brazil and New York even after they lost China to Mao Tse Tung.The same ignorance and naivety coupled with the desire to dominate Asia led to the American debacles in Korea and Vietnam. Just as the Americans had no idea what Mao was like (they only saw the flashy but hollow Chiang), they had no idea what Ho Chi Minh was like because they saw only their own puppet, President Ngo Dinh Diem, who, like Chiang, was a Christian president in a Buddhist country. These two episodes are found in the last chapters of the book. They are relevant to the question ‘Who lost China?’ which was raised. Bradley pointed out that most Americans do not know that Mao offered his hand in friendship to America but was spurned until 1973 when President Nixon finally paid homage to the Celestial City as did foreigners since the ancient history of the Middle Kingdom.It seems that America is still perceiving the China mirage when it constantly sees China as a threat to regional and world peace when in fact it might be America itself that creates and poses that very threat. To that end, Bradley's book can be enlightening - but only if America wishes to see clearly.This book is lucidly written and explains the greed and political ambition, cunning (and naivety) in politics and international relations. The book is 376 pages long but can be read in a day because it is impossible to put down.","6 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00U9SEGJY%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhMTCCH8XHzMHMA3gQHT%252FnqJ4J0aewckgNAuxGSepmcIrAAAAAGQvx4QAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR3K0HZONN1MRE9&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hMTCCH8XHzMHMA3gQHT%2FnqJ4J0aewckgNAuxGSepmcIrAAAAAGQvx4QAAAAB&reviewId=R3K0HZONN1MRE9","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
"Steven M. Anthony","4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Good History, Shaky Conclusions","2016年9月28日 在美国审核","","The author’s premise in this non-fiction work is that cultural ignorance on the part of American leadership in the early 20th century led to repeated conflicts in southeast Asia (World War II, Korean War and Vietnam War), which were entirely avoidable.Starting with Theodore Roosevelt and extending through his cousin Franklin Roosevelt, the author lays out a historical narrative that reflects very poorly not only on the Presidents, but also on most of his advisors.  The author repeatedly brings up the fact that the Roosevelt family fortune (along with many others in eastern American high society) was rooted in the 19th century opium trade with China.  This created something of an affinity for the country, without any actual knowledge or experience, leading to a complete misunderstanding of the cultural and political landscape.While I was somewhat familiar with the issues leading up to the Pacific theater of World War II, the more detailed and extensive backstory was unknown to me.  The same goes for my knowledge of the Chinese Civil War.  These parts of the book were very helpful and educational.  I can’t say, however, that I fully support the author’s underlying conclusions.Certainly, the outbreak of the Pacific hostilities could have been delayed for a period, but to suggest that war with Japan could have been entirely avoided is at best naïve.  And to promote the idea that the United States should have allied with Mao Zedong and Ho Chi Minh is pretty blatant historical revisionism and not realistic given the tenor of the times.  I think we can all agree that many historical events could and should have been avoided, however doing so in hindsight, especially employing vastly different social, cultural and political mores, is an exercise in futility.","3 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00U9SEGJY%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhL6v1BxPJOK8HYfIXUXUJFeClhzl3ruTuxiPB4hGbiYpAAAAAGQvx4QAAAAB%26reviewId%3DRS6VD30H4T990&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hL6v1BxPJOK8HYfIXUXUJFeClhzl3ruTuxiPB4hGbiYpAAAAAGQvx4QAAAAB&reviewId=RS6VD30H4T990","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

America has been messing around in Asia for a century and a half and we still don't get it.The author has some sort of vendetta against the Roosevelt cousins. He really wants to point out that they had no idea what they were doing and how those actions caused a lot of death and destruction. I wish at the beginning of the book he would just come out and say I don't like them and here is why. This book has a similar feel to ""The Imperial Cruise"" where the author again goes on a tirade against TR.There also seems to be an issue with Mao in this book. Anything evil or bad that he may have done is sort of skipped over. The author seems to go out of his way to show that Mao wanted to be our friend but we weren't interested. He left out the part about Mao doing a lot of killing of his own people to achieve power. Chiang on the other hand gets the rough treatment from Mr Bradley. He's in cahoots with the FDR so he doesn't get a pass on anything. Any bad quote from anyone is included. I'm not passing judgement. Just an observation.This is not the story you read in your high school textbooks. It's one that everyone should read. It's not flattering to the Roosevelt cousins.","2 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00U9SEGJY%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhIzqZ4%252B8SsQrOdRMq3jTb4M%252B3ZiV5ipOTOmKIpt9A%252FmUAAAAAGQvx4QAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR3N0C9DULW9T4Y&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hIzqZ4%2B8SsQrOdRMq3jTb4M%2B3ZiV5ipOTOmKIpt9A%2FmUAAAAAGQvx4QAAAAB&reviewId=R3N0C9DULW9T4Y","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

It was an eye opening account from the early 1800s and how the US, UK, and other ‘civilized’ countries forced trade upon the Asia countries. This led to the inlfux of opium into China and how these conuntries fostered and took advantage to a black market trade. I couldn’t belive how the Soong’s were able to understand and play the American feelings of ‘saving’ these peoples by bringing them Christian religions. To develop an organization that was able to get so much money from the US, and fool most of the country. It made me angry at how the people who knew the truth were shut down and dis-credited.I get the same uneasy feelings of a secret lobby group when I think of the secret discussions between the Russians and the Trump campaign. When you look at the US’ history, we are not very good at helping a conuntry and their people. I enjoyed the book for the information provided. It is a fine razors edge on when to get involved in a countries problems or to stay out. It is a shame that so many people, American, Chinese, Japanese, etc had to suffer and die.","报告","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00U9SEGJY%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhJm76kUGyUNXWTp6Fi2j33GYqKzvqkAMMgAGr3IOl7UiAAAAAGQvx4QAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR35ZYXF4TWXKJ&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","显示条评论","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hJm76kUGyUNXWTp6Fi2j33GYqKzvqkAMMgAGr3IOl7UiAAAAAGQvx4QAAAAB&reviewId=R35ZYXF4TWXKJ","","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

I am or was struck by the Wise Men in these policies and wonder what is so wise about men so stupid and hubris in their policies ans suggestions as to what to do next. They may be wise but they do not seem to have the intelligence to use their intelligence wisely, letting their arrogance get the best of their intelligence which should suggest better choices. I finished reading THE CHINA MIRAGE The Hidden History  Of American Disaster In Asia a few nights ago. It explains a lot of what I would call our blunderbuss foreign policy throughout the history of our nation. One definition, as I found in my dictionary defines blunderbuss as clumsy ans stupid. This does not say much about the people who elect them, but then they are so easily duped and lacking in initiative to act otherwise. The domino theory could be well applied to our foreign policies that lead to one blunder after another blunder in support of American Exceptionalism that is so much a part of the tragedy of America's foreign policy used as an excuse for the concept of manifest destiny.This is story of cause and effect by arrogant people who refuse to see and deny and only act upon the facade put before them, not making the effort to look beyond the facade and listen tho those who knew better and had more knowledge of the real China, not the public relations designed to put forth the best, the lies and the fantasy of the best foot forward.  We seem to want to live in a world were imperialism is justified and glorified, as with the British and other empires of the past and now the American Empire and shun and condemned those who know otherwise.  Our nation is living on myths, not reality, of fantasy instead of the reality of facts. Neither China nor Iran has ever attacked us, nor has Russia ever really been the threat it has been made out to be, even in the Cold War era. The United States has been the aggressor, making enemies along the way, making terrorists as we go along with our blunderbuss forging policies that only seem to perpetuate the war machines and the profiteers.THE CHINA MIRAGE is a well written and researched book. I thank James Bradley for that.  The last sentence, on the last page says a lot about our leaders,their failures and our failures to rise up against them. As you write""America has dispatched it hopeful sons and daughters to faraway Asia in search of a mirage that never was. And never will be.""","4 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00U9SEGJY%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhGw2gIjYx7%252BkBOxTYARXAc6eq575YQ7HN7f40lmnfCADAAAAAGQvx4QAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR3TX6RKY96BA8A&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hGw2gIjYx7%2BkBOxTYARXAc6eq575YQ7HN7f40lmnfCADAAAAAGQvx4QAAAAB&reviewId=R3TX6RKY96BA8A","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
"Glenn H.","3.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","A fascinating story, but how accurate is it?","2019年4月27日 在美国审核","","Before reading this book, I knew practically nothing about the history of America's involvement with China.  So it was a real eye-opener to read about the missteps, misestimations, and plain old blunders by which American leaders, primarily the Roosevelts and their brain trust, attempted to mold China into our own image while being completely ignorant of the real state of affairs in that land.However . . . the book did peripherally touch on matters on which I am knowledgeable -- specifically, Pacific War history -- and I came to realize that the author was pretty careless with the details.  He identified the Augusta as a battleship, instead of the heavy cruiser that she was.  He claimed that Guadalcanal was the America's first battle of the war, something that would have been news to those who fought at the preceding battles of Wake, Java, Coral Sea, Midway, etc.  He claimed that B-52 bombers burned Tokyo to the ground, when in fact the planes were B-29s; the B-52 didn't even enter service until 10 years after the Tokyo raid.  And speaking of the Tokyo raid, he claimed that it took place on March 11, 1945; but, rather amusingly, he quoted -- in the very same paragraph (!) -- the raid's leader as saying (correctly) that it took place on the night of March 9-10.Admittedly, these are minor faults, and they have no bearing on the main thrust of the story.  But I couldn't help but wonder, if the author wasn't able to get such minor and easily verifiable details as these correct, how accurate were his more important points?Finally, the author made two major points that didn't sit well with me.  The first was a recurring comparison between the two leaders battling for control of China, the Nationalist Chiang Kai-shek and the Communist Mao Zedong, which essentially boiled down to ""Chiang bad, Mao good.""  The main body of this book gives not the slightest hint that the ""good"" Chairman Mao was directly responsible for the intentional deaths of millions of his countrymen.  (To be fair, this fact is acknowledged -- barely -- in the footnotes.) The other point was the author's contention that America's embargo of oil shipments to Japan was the cause of World War II in the Pacific.  In other words, he blames America for the war.  But I would submit that the fault lies with Japan, for having launched a war of aggression against first China, and later America and her allies.  The oil embargo might have been the catalyst to push Japan to war against the United States, but there would have been no war if Japan -- not America -- hadn't taken aggressive actions in the first place.So all in all, this book was quite an interesting read; and I suspect that the account of American ignorance and duplicity contains more than a little truth.  But given the factual mistakes that I know of, and the revisionist conclusions about China's leaders and about whose fault the war was, I am left in doubt as to the total level of trustworthiness of this account.","3 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00U9SEGJY%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhKgncvEli3FEFx6cZvjLr2jx%252BB0EtqNRPgyuWlFT%252Fj9HAAAAAGQvx4QAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR150HIGAWDF97H&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hKgncvEli3FEFx6cZvjLr2jx%2BB0EtqNRPgyuWlFT%2Fj9HAAAAAGQvx4QAAAAB&reviewId=R150HIGAWDF97H","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
"Lloyd Lofthouse","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","A democracy that lost its way more than a century ago","2015年5月29日 在美国审核","","The China Mirage, backed by overwhelming factual evidence that was suppressed or ignored for decades, clearly reveals that America is not the peace loving democracy that most Americans think it is. The reality is that the U.S. is a global empire that took its first step toward World War II in the Pacific on July 8, 1853, when Commodore Matthew Perry commanded a U.S. Navy squadron that sailed into Tokyo harbor aboard the frigate Susquehanna. Perry—under orders from President Millard Fillmore—demanded a treaty permitting trade and the opening of Japanese ports to U.S. merchant ships. The reluctant Japanese leaders, who wanted to be left alone, were not given a choice if they wanted to avoid the same invasion of China mainly by the British and French during the Opium Wars that China lost.After being forced to open its doors to Western trade so American corporations could profit, Japan industrialized and built a modern military. The second step toward war in the Pacific took place about fifty years later when President Theodore (Teddy) Roosevelt started to meddle in Asia’s affairs.The book reveals that Teddy urged Japan to invade Korea in 1910 leading eventually to Japan’s invasion of China, because Teddy was obsessed with the Japanese and felt strongly that Japan’s role should be to protect Asia from being colonized by the European colonial powers even if it meant Japan’s military would dominate all of Asia.The third step toward war in the Pacific would be the bumbling, ignorant, secretive, back-stabbing, dysfunctional and manipulative administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt—with help from the powerful and wealthy lying Christian China Lobby that based its thinking on a faulty premise that the Chinese loved democracy and wanted to become a Christian country just like the United States.The powerful China Lobby’s ignorant agenda would cause the deaths of more than 25 million civilians (most of them Chinese) and 6 million troops (most of them Chinese) in addition to the bombed out devastation of Southeast Asia, China, Korea and Japan.The same ignorant and arrogant thinking caused the Vietnam War where U.S. troops fought for almost 20 years, and the United States dropped more bombs on Southeast Asia than it did in all of World War II.Readers will discover that Henry Luce, the publisher of Time and Life Magazines, who was called the most influential private citizen in America at the time, was a perfect example of how anyone who has too much power and wealth can create their own reality based on lies that often evaporate later leaving future generations to deal with the damage caused by these fools.I bought the unabridged audio book at Costco","2 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00U9SEGJY%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhCnu0tjkDzyktalWL4ULr2PJIZFDY%252BhTQR1Pn6Un67l4AAAAAGQvx4QAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR1RBIPA0KD9AXP&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hCnu0tjkDzyktalWL4ULr2PJIZFDY%2BhTQR1Pn6Un67l4AAAAAGQvx4QAAAAB&reviewId=R1RBIPA0KD9AXP","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
"Thomas G","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Vivid, Live and Fascinating Scholarship","2015年6月12日 在美国审核","","Like a lot of people I was fascinated by Flags Of Our Fathers and considered it a great son to father story that the fame of Bradley's father aside any son brought up in a loving household such as his would have wanted to write to pay homage to their dad. If James Bradley had stopped with that book it would have in no way shape or form made him the proverbial one hit wonder. He further honed his skills with his next two volumes that like Flags tackled singular events with a combination of storytelling, perspective and background. His latest work The China Mirage solidify his skills as an historian by outlining the history of US-China relations and how those relations impacted the two nations in the Second World War, Korea and Vietnam and still to this day color most Americans perceptions of China.It is a story that has previously been told in parts. There are many biographies and autobiographies where key players in this continuing drama tell their story. There are also many fine works of history that touch upon certain aspects of this story as relates to the specific subject that a particular author is addressing. There however have been no works that this reader is aware of anyway that attempt to relate the story as a coherent whole. In that endeavor the author very much succeeds. Sometimes the proof of squarely hitting a target is the criticisms you receive for doing so. Some of the scholarly reviews that I have read on this work show just how deeply ingrained many of our false impressions of China are, have been and continue to this day.Many of our countries policy decisions regarding China have been colored for decades as Bradley so ably documents by the China Lobby. The myth that the US lost China persists to this day even though you cannot lose something that was not yours to begin with. Yet it continues to impact how we as a nation relate to China to this day. Rather than mentioning specific people or events that Bradley speaks about in his work , I will suffice it to say acquire it and read it yourself. To do anything else might spoil some of the many surprises contained within its covers.","4 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00U9SEGJY%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhBaRIzK60OYjFDaOPWMMX1nBCrYBmItsiQlSwTNZptczAAAAAGQvx4QAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR5QW52IHL75V5&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hBaRIzK60OYjFDaOPWMMX1nBCrYBmItsiQlSwTNZptczAAAAAGQvx4QAAAAB&reviewId=R5QW52IHL75V5","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
"George Z","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Very enlightening book on how we got into a war with Japan","2018年8月12日 在美国审核","","In 1940 Japan had gotten two thirds of its oil  and much steel for military and industrial use from California ports and the balance from the Dutch East Indies. President Roosevelt had hoped to check Japan's aggressive take over of Korea, Manchuria northern China by partnering with General Chiang Kai-shek and the American educated  Soong family (including his wife, Madame Chiang) that supported him.  However, Chiang's main interest was in fighting Mao Zhedong and his army of peasants. The Soong family spent its energies convincing Washington that Chiang was winning battles against the Japanese when the reality was just the opposite.  Because of the Chinese Exclusion Act of the 1883 there were hardly any Chinese on the East Coast who could provide Washington with the real story of Chiang's corruption, brutality and an army that was forced into service and totally incompetent and unmotivated.Roosevelt's strategy was to concentrate on the war in Europe and appease Japan by continuing to supply it with much needed oil.  However, the book goes on to explain how a group of State Department officials conspired to embargo the oil which left Japan no choice but to capture the oil fields of the Dutch East Indies. The US Navy fleet anchored in Pearl Harbor thus had to be eliminated.  In Japan's eyes the American Embargo was the first blow in the Pacific war.James Bradley presents this story in fascinating detail in this well written book.","2 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00U9SEGJY%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhCnZVbMkRh1aKm9hQoorxDdUbTrY03eWDvPiY27%252FkdQOAAAAAGQvx4UAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR3TFGS0413P5C7&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hCnZVbMkRh1aKm9hQoorxDdUbTrY03eWDvPiY27%2FkdQOAAAAAGQvx4UAAAAB&reviewId=R3TFGS0413P5C7","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

American missionaries misrepresenting the reality of China, skewing  American political perceptions resulting in tragic results.

"D. Kamp","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Thank Goodness for this Book!","2016年1月19日 在美国审核","","If like me, you hated the study of history (especially asian history) while in school, you really need to read this book.  What confounded me in school was it seemed like none of the facts presented made any logical sense.  But when you first start reading this book, it seems like a history lesson that is sounding crazy, but it isn't long before all the disjointed historical facts start clicking together with crystal clear reality.  Suddenly - all the pieces of the puzzle fit and make perfect sense.Suddenly, the Roosevelt's aren't such hero's as our history writers would like for us to believe and accept without question.  Upon close and critical inspection, it's is now my opinion they are both a couple of ham-fisted, arrogant, sneaky buggars, who seemed to take pleasure in putting it over on the people whom the professed to serve.  By the way; you need to read, ""The Imperial Cruise"" prior to this book in order to get the whole perspective.Another eye opening book on FDR is Burt Folsom Jr's, ""New Deal or Raw Deal"".  In Chapter 1 is titled, ""The Making of the Myth:  FDR and the New Deal"".  It takes an honest look at our traditional historians and how hidden agendas and personal biases lead to a distorted presentation of the characters.After reading Bradley's and Folsom's books I got to thinking:  Gee, maybe if I was a good lier and manipulator, maybe I could be a US President some day too.  Where oh where has the idea of limited government gone?  Who out there would disagree that these leaders of our country need a shorter leash?A nice high note in the book was when Mayling came to President Harry Truman in '48 begging for another handout as the walls were crashing down around Chiang Kai-Shek.  ""I discovered after some time, that Chiang Kai-Shek and the Madame and their families, the Soong family and the Kungs, were all thieves, every last one of them..."".

"Yu H. Chou","3.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","A very good and detailed account for the long tangled history of America/Asia relationship, however, I think the author is bias","2015年5月7日 在美国审核","","Well, as a Taiwanese immigrant, I appreciate Mr. Bradley's work digging through history and give us a detailed account of what happened. However, his interpretation of history is greatly flawed. He chose to ignore the suffering of Communist China's disastrous regime, the corruption of current Chinese government, the oppression the Chinese government is exerting on the people of China. He chose to focus on the benefit of America, how to avoid war even with the price of sacrificing Chinese people's democracy and human rights. I am also very very offended by his comment of 'Taiwan being part of China and will be part of China'. You know, there are more than 23 millions of people living on that island enjoying the democracy and freedom that they fought long and hard with. Mr. Bradley, you might know a lot of historic facts and events, your family may have had some special experience wit conflicts, but it is the rhetoric like yours that helped Nazi in WWII and ISIS in today.","27 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00U9SEGJY%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhPKTghlHBOUSkIG3qg%252FO7JNhiCGkqiXN9ZN6r3%252BhgegUAAAAAGQvx4UAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR3QIZY2Q6I1RVY&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hPKTghlHBOUSkIG3qg%2FO7JNhiCGkqiXN9ZN6r3%2BhgegUAAAAAGQvx4UAAAAB&reviewId=R3QIZY2Q6I1RVY","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

He has touched all the key events and people. I was amazed to find how powerful the China lobby was in influencing and directing our foreign policy moves in the 1940s. This is a book which should be require reading in colleges teaching American history. The author suggests we might avoided fighting in both Korea and Vietnam had we listened to State Dept. experts who sadly were removed due to McCarthy's witch hunt.

"Stuart Shapiro","3.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Real Strengths and Weaknesses","2021年6月18日 在美国审核","","The ironic thing about The China Mirage is that it is at its best when discussing Japan.  The section on Baron Kaneko's courtship of Teddy Roosevelt and Japan's reaction to oil sanctions in the months leading up to Pearl Harbor are fascinating and insightfulAnd to credit the author, his main point, that Chiang Kai Shek and the Soongs aided and abetted by Henry Luce, Henry Stimson and the ""China Lobby"" subverted US policy on China and did a huge disservice to the Chinese people is spot on.So what are the drawbacks?  There are three main ones.  First, is the author's tendency to hit you over the head with his thesis.  He repeats his charges over and over again as if we are a jury, not book readers.  Second, his connection to Korea and especially Vietnam seems tacked on.  As a result, it is hard to evaluate his argument the the China mirage was responsible for these conflicts (I suspect it played a role but is far more complicated than the author lets on).But the biggest drawback is the minimization of the horribleness of the other choices besides Chiang in the 1930s and 1940s.  He dismisses criticism of Mao in a few sentences and thereby ignores the fact that he would go on to be one of the horrible despots of the 20th Century.

"Daboomer","3.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","If the Harvard men blew it, could the guys from Notre Dame done better?","2015年6月22日 在美国审核","","Fascinating story of the United States' misunderstanding of China, and the resulting cultural, economic, political and human costs.My complaint and it's enormous because it is ubiquitous in the book, is Bradley's inability to simply tell the story without framing it through his political philosophy, neatly summed up on page 346 of the hardback edition.  Editorializing on Dean Acheson's memoir, he writes, ""...the aging Wise Man didn't mention perhaps his biggest contribution to modern America: the secret policy that he as secretary of state had inspired and that reoriented the United States, changing it from a robust democracy with a small professional military into the militarized national security state it had become by the time he published his book.""  Bradley apparently believes there was a sea change in the 40s and 50s, let's call it The United States Mirage.Bradley makes the case for how we could have avoided WW II through continued sale of oil and other raw materials to Japan.  Really?  How is our  support of Japan's imperialism any less appalling than support of US gunboat diplomacy imperialism?There are four men Bradley admires, John Service and two state department associates, and Mao Zedong. Bradley theorizes that if we'd only embraced Mao when we had the chance, we'd have an idyllic trade based relationship with China and would have avoided the Korean and Vietnamese wars would have never been fought - after all, Mao, only wanted what was best for the 400 million Chinese peasants.  Perhaps.  However, perhaps there is room for skepticism of Bradley's thesis based on the millions of said peasants who died after Mao consolidated power and unified the country under his rule.If there are four men who Bradley admires, there are many, many who are venal, blind to the facts, and like concrete, all mixed up and then set.  These include every President from President Theodore Roosevelt forward, Pearl S Buck, and especially anyone who set foot in Harvard.  Yes, they got it wrong and in China backed Chiang Kai-shek, but where's the evidence that Mao would have been any more benign than Stalin or any other of the mid-century despots.  I'd have been so much more enjoyed this book if Bradley could have just told the facts and let me draw my own conclusions.","4 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00U9SEGJY%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhLCw7XvjSo6%252Fo1j9aaf%252FPioE83PTLe4XBbwtqOhqbkFHAAAAAGQvx4cAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR25YOCPM2RO7WT&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hLCw7XvjSo6%2Fo1j9aaf%2FPioE83PTLe4XBbwtqOhqbkFHAAAAAGQvx4cAAAAB&reviewId=R25YOCPM2RO7WT","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

"Isaac D.","1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Opinionated Revisionist History","2019年5月12日 在美国审核","","I was very disappointed in this book, especially since I thought Bradley's book ""Flags of Our Fathers"" was excellent. This book, however, presents a very skewed view of history that makes highly selective use of facts to bolster the author's case, which is essentially that we got snookered into fighting Japan in WWII by China.He grossly minimizes Japan's aggression and inhuman atrocities and implies that they were merely doing what they had to do was a reaction to U.S. foreign policy. This view completely ignores the absolute brutality of their expansionist ambitions that led to their occupation of China and Korea.The second major problem I had was his glorifying of Mao Zedong and some sort of great, righteous leader that we failed to recognize. Sure, Chiang Kai-Shek was a fascist who pulled the wool over the eyes of most Americans, but that's pretty much common knowledge now, not some sort of ""hidden history."" And when Bradly presents a China that would have been so much better off if we had aligned with Mao rather than Chiang, it borders on complete nonsense. All one has to do is look at how Taiwan turned out compared to China under Mao. Taiwan ultimately became a democracy and an economic powerhouse, while China under Mao turned into a regime far more repressive than Chiang's ever was, and such an economic disaster that tens of millions of people died of starvation.I don't know what the author's agenda is in writing this book, but his warped view of history does not stand up to the facts.","17 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00U9SEGJY%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhERcYghkHESzRzY4B6VbYRNWGUr63iz1h5EcG1Tn5qwkAAAAAGQvx4gAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR2X8SWGNY5BH8V&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hERcYghkHESzRzY4B6VbYRNWGUr63iz1h5EcG1Tn5qwkAAAAAGQvx4gAAAAB&reviewId=R2X8SWGNY5BH8V","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

For example how would anyone know their grand father became immensely wealthy from opium trade forced on China at the turn of the century!! Also how will the general even educated public ever know that MAO at the beginning of his ""revolution"" i.e. uplifting the millions of down trodden peasants at the expense of their oppressive ""landlords/owners"", reached out to American government for help several times?!  I also learned that General Stilwell was not well received in the high echelon of U S. military and the state department because at the beginning of WWII he went to China to observe.

"LT","1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","An Inadvertent Mirage of Chinese Communists","2020年4月16日 在美国审核","","To unveil the China Mirage, the author inadvertently created a Mirage of the Chinese Communist Party(CCP). While there were many astounding facts in this book, the author failed to recognize the most fatal character of CCP, DECEPTION. Behind the happy new farm workers were the many murdered, suicided, or imprisoned land owners of generations, who not only lost the land without any compensation but wore a political scarlet letter for life and for the whole family and descendants. In the front line of the CCP army during the civil wars against the Nationalist were the innocent civilians whom CCP used as their shields and would never be able to complain. Who is best at staging for foreign visitors? CCP has been doing it for decades and still does. I hope the author has seen the deadly consequences of helping the CCP strive by now, especially after COVID-19 virus outbreak. Lots of the world organizations are controlled by China now and started to malfunction: WTO, WHO, just to name a few. The world order is now a mirage because of CCP's participation.In contrast, the Nationalists, who were corrupted and chased out of China landed in Taiwan. Taiwan had land reform too. But land owners were compensated. Taiwan has since evolved into a mature democracy following Lincoln's and Sun, Yat-Sen's three principles (of the people, by the people, for the people),  which the author ridiculed.  Though not a country of Christen majority, Taiwanese enjoy and value freedom of religion and speech, civil rights, right of property and among others  as the American. Taiwan has a world-envy health system and is proudly holding crucial and leading positions in modern technologies such as semi-conductor and computer hardware. There are still many mountains to climb for Taiwan. But Taiwan has proven CCP is never the right choice of Chinese ally for Americans at any time, in the past or at present.","3 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00U9SEGJY%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhO0ucK8AWov%252Bgytu5x%252BTkwGReEF%252BjnRuGw7LwtGMtiMoAAAAAGQvx4gAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR19VW1QL1GJKKN&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hO0ucK8AWov%2Bgytu5x%2BTkwGReEF%2BjnRuGw7LwtGMtiMoAAAAAGQvx4gAAAAB&reviewId=R19VW1QL1GJKKN","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
"david sorenson","1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Bad history, badly done","2016年3月12日 在美国审核","","Having read ""Flyboys,"" I had relatively high expectations for this book, but in the end it is very disappointing. The argument is that the ""China mirage,"" a set of myths perpetuated by the China opium traders, novelists (Pearl S. Buck), and romanticized evangelists somehow captured FDR's policy makers to cut off all oil trade to Japan in response to its brutal treatment of China. But Bradley never makes his case, indeed more careful treatments of the topic (Jeffrey Record, ""A War They Knew They Would Lose"") notes that strategic calculations drove Roosevelt's advisors decision to cut off oil exports, rather than the influence of the so-called China lobby. The book is marred by silly writing (Felix Frankfurter's advisors are called the ""hot dogs,"" Dean Acheson is ""the wise man,"" and so on. George Marshall is described as ""the man who had won World War II for FDR (p. 334), disregarding the hundreds of thousands of men and women who really won the war. The book has too many errors (the Pearl Harbor commanders are described as ""barely speaking to each other,"" disregarding Irving Janis' argument in ""Groupthink"" that they were in fact too close to warn each other of the pending danger of a Japanese attack. General Lemay's World War II bombers are called ""B-52's,"" which much have been a surprise to the Vietnam B-52 flyers -- the bombers used against Japan were B-29s, completely different bombers. Chennault's aviators are dismissed, showing the author's ignorance of the Salween River campaign which stopped the Japanese advance into southern China.Because of its silly writing style, its unsupported thesis, and its numerous mistakes, this book is a great disappointment.","15 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00U9SEGJY%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhAI6RBDXlXH3cZhG9XrmrHHrvaICzgSkkFtZrE7iQ1JwAAAAAGQvx4gAAAAB%26reviewId%3DRS1HG3Q7PFX2N&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hAI6RBDXlXH3cZhG9XrmrHHrvaICzgSkkFtZrE7iQ1JwAAAAAGQvx4gAAAAB&reviewId=RS1HG3Q7PFX2N","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

"Geary Foertsch","2.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Mr. Bradley should apologize to Joe McCarthy","2015年8月26日 在美国审核","","I generally like James Bradley's work but in ""The China Mirage,""  he misses the extensive impact of communist influence in the Federal government during the '30s, '40s and '50s that has been documented thoroughly now as a result of the released U.S. Army's Venona transcripts (Venona: Decoding Soviet Espionage in America"", Haynes and Klehr) and authors like M.Stanton Evans. His typical denigration of Joe McCarthy and homage to diplomat John Stewart Service indicates thin research of current sources available about the times. Here's an example:Mr. Bradley writes about ""McCarthyism, the witch hunt for the enemy within"" (page334) and mentions McCarthy ""fearmongering"" (pg.342) but fails to mention that there were hundreds of communist spies reaching high levels in the federal government undermining U.S. policy.  Chief among them were John Service associates Lauchlin Currie, personal assistant to FDR, and Solomon Adler, senior Treasury Dept. official. Others include Alger Hiss, State Dept., Harry Dexter White, Treasury, Klaus Fuchs, atomic scientist and many more.In Chapter 12 (Who Lost China?)  he absolves John Service's involvement in transferring military and intelligence documents to communist Phillip Jaffe who ran the pro-red magazine ""Amerasia,"" calling the documents ""innocuous."" Bradley says, all investigations of Service, ""concluded that Service was innocent and had caused no harm.""  In reality the FBI impounded roughly 1000 documents from the Amerasia office and Service's State Dept. office. about 25% of which concerned military matters with a warning that possession violated the Espionage Act. Hoover called it ""an airtight case"" ready for prosecution but it was politically fixed. The FBI knew this because it had wiretapped the fixers and had logs of phone calls of the conspiracy to free Service (see Blacklisted from History, M. Stanton Evans page 117-122).Mr. Bradley needs to read Mr. Evans definitive history and recognize that Joe McCarthy was more right than wrong.","6 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00U9SEGJY%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhOZIE7q1jdhTSpJVHwyI5FOlZfqZDLBKKDL33MS8RmmUAAAAAGQvx4oAAAAB%26reviewId%3DRSITE40K2NSNR&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hOZIE7q1jdhTSpJVHwyI5FOlZfqZDLBKKDL33MS8RmmUAAAAAGQvx4oAAAAB&reviewId=RSITE40K2NSNR","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

Mao literally killed millions of Chinese with his communist ideology.  Americans can have a sense of pride that we rejected Mao and wanted nothing to do with him until Richard Nixon embraced him.  Chang, the nationalist leader of China, fled to Taiwan.  The author suggests that we should never have been friends with Chang and that Mao was a far better leader.  All we have to do is look at how Taiwan turned out to see that we were right to stand with Chang, and not Mao.

He lost all credibility pretty early on for me.There is also an insinuation that America’s wealth is built upon the the mid 19th century opium trade in China (x, y and z family made ALL their money in opium originally, and then they turned around to use that money investing in the industrialization of America; seriously).","1 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00U9SEGJY%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhJ6Mx7T9J%252F42ybPL04KyC3tGhzgUARuS9vn8JwfzNLYoAAAAAGQvx4oAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR29FI7DYLAPFOX&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hJ6Mx7T9J%2F42ybPL04KyC3tGhzgUARuS9vn8JwfzNLYoAAAAAGQvx4oAAAAB&reviewId=R29FI7DYLAPFOX","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

What difference, at this point, does it make?)  and lack of sustained military support for Chiang during the civil war was the great tragedy and failure of US foreign policy.","5 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00U9SEGJY%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhCCgM0rdSDygHgkrWdpAl9Uk4WoM%252BLBAqjlq0kQpE3QmAAAAAGQvx4sAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR52N1Q6FZDCG1&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hCCgM0rdSDygHgkrWdpAl9Uk4WoM%2BLBAqjlq0kQpE3QmAAAAAGQvx4sAAAAB&reviewId=R52N1Q6FZDCG1","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
"C. Lu","1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Very biased book, lots of misinterpretation of facts","2017年1月6日 在美国审核","","This is a fundamentally misleading book. As a Chinese American, I have read many books about Sino-American policy, history and relationship, both in English and Chinese. The author bases his judgement on the wrong assumption that Communists in China were eager to make friends with America and did not realize that it was just part of their systematic and deceiving propaganda. I am very disappointed that even today, there are still so-called experts like James Bradley who believe the talks of one of the biggest liars in the history-Mao, and put his quotation on the beginning of the book as evidence of truth.","7 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00U9SEGJY%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhH7IBrk1kDQQ5n%252FkMJpOU%252BPE2YWCGI2W1s%252BvVui8ejteAAAAAGQvx4wAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR26BX5RETAE293&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hH7IBrk1kDQQ5n%2FkMJpOU%2BPE2YWCGI2W1s%2BvVui8ejteAAAAAGQvx4wAAAAB&reviewId=R26BX5RETAE293","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

It described an almost mildly positive view of Mao which is shocking to anyone who has a glimpse of  modern China history.

"Walter W. Ko","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","China Mirage - now and then?!","2016年2月21日 在美国审核","","The China Mirage is a concise chronicle of America’s misguided domestic and foreign policies in Asia during the past century, many of which still are affecting today’s international relations.  This book is an extension and elaboration of Bradley’s previous best seller, “Imperial Cruise” with a different focus on the romance of USA, China and Japan. The book begins with quotes from two Presidents Roosevelt. First, President Theodore Roosevelt, having recognized the powerful and aggressive Japan after Meiji Restoration defeated China and Russia, adopted a secret encouragement that a “Japanese Monroe Doctrine” in Asia will remove the temptation to European encroachment and Japan will be recognized as the leader of the Asiatic Nations”. Second FDR was quoted “The people of China well over a century have been, in thought and in objective, closer to us Americans than almost any other peoples in the world – the same great ideals.  China, in the last – less than half a century has become one of the great democracies of the world”. Bradley traces that the dark wealth of famous “Fortune Tops” families was made in China by following the British and pushing opium to the Chinese people and labeling them as “Sick Man of Asia” after addition. With many military defeats by Western Powers, China was forced to sign humiliating unequal treaties demanding extraterritoriality – freedom from Chinese laws and the right to try their own transgressors, and the most-favor-nation clause – all foreign powers would share the same equal privilege what a western power could squeeze from China. Bradley informs that following these forced concessions by China, Western countries established regional “treaty ports” as foreign enclaves dominated by modern, western, “civilized” and Christian exchanges.  Missionaries arrived promoting their own Western religious version a”Kingdom of Heaven”.  Religious, political and economic conflicts caused the Boxer Movement resulted in the Eight Nation Invasion to Peking in 1900.  It ended in Boxer Indemnity the following year with the subsequent establishment of Tsing Hua University for American technology and democracy.Chinese people remembered the harsh law of Chinese Exclusion Act passed by US Congress on 1882 to stop Chinese laborers from entering America.  And Bradley introduces readers to Charles Soong a smart and fortunate individual whose Christian influence Sino-American relation for a century by his children and their families.  His was considered the prime idyllic family that enthusiastic missionaries were excited about as a model for eternal life and democracy and the greater success of China.  Educated in America, the three Christian Soong sisters were molded into different characters, Ailing being fortune hungry, Ching Ling being patriotic and Mei Ling being power loving.  The military strong man Chiang Kai Shek walked down the Christian path of baptism in order to take Mei Ling as his bride.  So with great American writers such as Pearl Buck and Henry Luce, they fed American people with their versions of Chinese experience, the people, poor and innocent, and rich and powerful.  Such illusions created a favorable impression for American Christians who were all too eager to help their Chinese brethren into the nation of democracy and Christianity. Pearl commented: “China is knocking at American doors . . . entering eagerly into the colleges and universities, examining critically all that she sees, seizing ideas which she thinks will be useful to her, and returning again to her own land to use her new knowledge in her own fashion”.  Pearl powerful statement of wisdom, certainly is true now and then. However, Missionaries also knew that Christian Chiang was a one party despot with legions of Blue Shirt thugs terrorizing the populace.  Nevertheless, America accepted the status quo of Japanese Puppet State of Manchukuo as seen in the movie “The Last Emperor” while League of Nations was incapable of stopping Japanese aggression in China.  Still through rosy glasses, T V Soong presented to the world a picture of a new China whose population admired America and yearned to embrace Jesus and Jefferson.  The China Lobby perpetuated this  mirage as they asked for more money and weapon to fight against Japanese invaders. All the while, US officials looked away as financial aids mystically disappeared into some rich, powerful and famous bank accounts. Bradley makes a comparison from Stilwell on Chiang and Mao  which is insightful good for understanding America national policy.  Mao extended his hand and friendship to US through John Service.  It is interesting in the interview, Mao said: “China must industrialize only by free enterprise and with the aid of foreign capital . . . Chinese and American interests are correlated and similar.  They fit together, economically and politically.  We can and must work together. . . “.  Mao was visionary right then and now.  However, he was ignored. It was only when President Nixon visited China in 1972, Mao had the opportunity to express to the number one anti-communist world leader his admiration of “most respected enemy”.  Bradley also compared and contrasted how UK and US treated Chinese Chiang by Churchill and FDR. Japan understood well what Asia Monroe Doctrine meant for Imperial Empire.  In the name of the Emperor as Asia liberator, the Imperial Army tried to remove by duplicate European encroachment in Asia in brutal atrocities. When US declared steel and oil sanctions to starve  Japanese war machine, Japanese advisers to the Emperor felt that Japan was provoked into a war of self-defense and self-preservation.  This false argument was spun into Emperor Hirohito’s 1945 radio broadcast to Japanese people in Imperial Rescript on the Termination of War then to the recent Prime Minister Shino Abe’s dismissal of Tokyo war crime trials in the aftermath of WW II as nothing more than “victors’ justice”. As Japan surrendered unconditionally, US chose a “politically correct” way of helping Chiang under many wise men advice on how best to achieve the US post-war goals coming from many circles of influence.  The religious right’s “man of the hour” was Chiang who unfortunately made war torn Chinese economy worse leading to the Chinese people lost confidence in his abilities, as the one with the mandate of heaven in his statesmanship and saviorIn contrast, Mao won the hearts and minds of the majority Chinese people who forsake the corrupt Chiang as they hoped for a new modern, industrialized and independent China. Mao commented with John Service: “. . . for America to insist that arms be given to all forces who fight Japan, which will include the Communists, is not interference.  For America to give arms only to Chiang will  in effect be interference [ in the domestic affairs of another country]”.  Seeing “The East is Red”, US kept betting on Chiang, with the red scare and decline Mao’s hand of friendship asking for help.  Such refusal pushed Mao into the bosom bear hug of Kremlin.  The mood in Washington was: The Republicans took on the fight against the Communists as a moral cause; the military men were concerned about a future conflict with the USSR; and the churchmen embraced it as a struggle against the Antichrist in Asia. With adoption of  Acheson’s NSC-68 called for worldwide containment of Communism,.  America asserted itself as a nation built on democracy and self-determination and the beacon of hope for the oppressed colonial dominated Korea and Vietnam.  And a populace misled about the true nature of the state of affair in China, Korea and Vietnam.  The election outcomes of Korea and Vietnam, being turned out not to the expected like, resulted in US military intervention and confrontation in Asia leading to disaster after disaster. The China Mirage, a serious research study bringing to light how poorly understood US actions in Asia over the past hundred years, has led to today’s policy blunders and misunderstandings,  from Theodore Roosevelt down to Obama.  Bradley shows what is old and new, mirage and reality, rich and poor, love and hatred, win and loss, democracy and totalitarian, friend and foe, blue and red. By reviewing the history of Sino-American relations, he helps us all understand the future.  Is it the Tao of yin and yang that US and China were comrades in arm allies in defeating Japan in WW II and now US and Japan are allies in confronting China?  It makes one wonder who attacked Pearl Harbor, the Day in Infamy?Years ago, Walter Cronkite produced a CBS program “Who Lost China”.  This title wording reveals much about how the wealth and power of the US is presently being employed worldwide, in an attempt to replicate American society for “gain”.  It means America has high expectation of seeing China in the envisioned self image of US, wealthy and powerful.  It is not that China does not achieve the goal but she takes her own unique path, not Soviet nor American, but from Dr. Sun Yat-sen’s The Three People’s Principles.This book covers many parts of history unknown to many Chinese and most Americans. Hopefully reading this book helps clear away this historical mirage leading to better understanding to prevent more disasters.  However, a few mirage typos do not impact the significance of the book, such as B29 (not B52) dropping napalm on Tokyo, 1862 (not 1892, p.32) and 1950 (not 1905, p.349).  Given the latest technology of communication, will the media, turning up their rhetoric demonizing China, risk the danger of once again fostering a Sino-Russia coalition in yet another cold-war mentality? Will the recent presidential candidates in their mysterious dreamy stereotype of using China as a scapegoat in stealing jobs, causing the national deficit and expecting “anchor baby”, employ the same excuse to wage another Opium War as the British cousin did in the Nineteen Century? Is it irresponsible freedom of speech to use China as convenient punching bag for political gain and vote, especially to perpetrate the optical illusion?  Why there is hysteria, paranoid and Sino-phobia to treat china as Satan reincarnated outside the Axis of Evil?  Those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.  For a better future and peace under heaven, this book is a must read for Chinese officials in Beijing, members of the US Congress and especially the President in Washington and American citizens and Chinese people everywhere.","1 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB00U9SEGJY%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhMi8I%252FbmNM9eZV2%252BB4edJPVI7NYwVU%252BgUK4EDMYO5RMvAAAAAGQvx4wAAAAB%26reviewId%3DRFISUASXE33V1&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hMi8I%2FbmNM9eZV2%2BB4edJPVI7NYwVU%2BgUK4EDMYO5RMvAAAAAGQvx4wAAAAB&reviewId=RFISUASXE33V1","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

"川流桃桜","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","誤解と偏見と嘘だらけの米中関係史","2022年5月3日 在日本审核","已确认购买","歴史と云うものが屢々誤解や偏見や、或いはあからさまな嘘によって動くことが多いのは周知の事実だが、本書は米帝が中国に対して抱き続けて来た幻想（蜃気楼）を明らかにすることによって、それがワシントンの対中政策をどれだけ歪めて来たのか、そしてそれが米帝自身の在り方をどれだけ損ない、中国のみならずアジア諸国にどれだけ甚大な犠牲を強い、何百万人もの命や生活を奪って来たのかを解き明かしたものだ。米国人が基本的に自国以外の事柄について救い難い程に無知であることは、目を開けている者ならば誰だって気が付くことだが（そしてそれは他の西側市民や名誉白人達についても多かれ少なかれ言えることだが）、彼等は他国を理解する為の努力をせず、他国の主権や文化や歴史や伝統や宗教や習俗に敬意を払わず、その癖他国に対してやたらと影響力を揮いたがる。中国が結局彼等のお気に入りの蒋介石の手に落ちずに、毛沢東率いる共産主義政権の支配下に置かれることが誰の目にも明らかになった時、米帝は傲慢にも”Who lost China?（我々が中国を失ったのは誰の所為だ？）”と云う問いを発したのだが、何故そもそも彼等が「中国は我々のものだ。中国がどんな未来を選ぶかは我々が決めてやるべきなのだ」と信じ込む様になったのか、本書を読めばその背景が理解出来る様になる。　本書の記述はフランリン・デラノ・ルーズヴェルトの祖父であるウォレン・デラノから始まる。米国人の中国に対する初期のイメージを形作ったのは主に宣教師と麻薬商人達だが、彼等は清朝によって定められた区域から出ようとせず、中国語を学ぼうとも中国人を理解しようともせず、ひたすら自分達の商品（キリスト教とアヘン）を相手に押し付けることばかり考えていた（前者は全く成果を挙げられなかった）。それが帰国して東海岸のエスタブリッシュメント層で大きな勢力となり、「白人が善導してやらなければ自力では前へ進めない停滞したアジア人」のイメージを広めた。「門戸開放政策」の名の下で他国の経済や文化や政治体制を破壊することで利益を得ていた麻薬商人達にとっては、相手を「非人間」のカテゴリーに貶めることは、自らの行動を正当化する恰好の言い訳になっただろう。　中国人の移民労働者が増えることで、米国人が現実の中国人と接する機会は一旦は増えたのだが、低賃金で勤勉に働く中国人労働者達に脅威を覚えた米国労働者達が差別的で暴力的な排斥運動をエスカレートさせた結果、中国人排斥法が成立し、米国人が中国人を知る機会は一気にまた極く限られたものとなる（他国の経済を破壊することで利益を上げながら、その国の人々が豊かさを求めて働きに来ると「自国の労働者を脅かす」と云う理由で排斥する、と云うパターンは、21世紀の今日でも欧米各国で起こっている。日本はまだ規模が小さいので外国人労働者排斥を主張している人は比較的少数に留まっているが、外国人労働者があからさまな差別的待遇を受けることが多いことはよく知られている）。これが中国に対する非現実的な蜃気楼を更に助長した。　米帝の収奪的アジア貿易販路確保の一環として行われた開国によって（朝鮮戦争を抜きにして第二次大戦後の日本国を語るのが欺瞞でしかない様に、阿片戦争を抜きにして明治維新を語るのは欺瞞でしかないと思う）アジアの新興帝国として開花した日本帝国は、西洋と同じく帝国主義的拡張事業に乗り出し、朝鮮半島の支配を巡って日清戦争を起こした訳だが、更に十年後には同じ問題でロシアと対決することになる。伊藤博文はハーヴァード大卒の金子堅太郎を特使として米帝に送り出し、流暢な英語による彼のPRに感激したセオドア・ルーズヴェルトは、日本人が「極東のヤンキー」になりたがっていると信じ込み、日本にアジア版のモンロー・ドクトリンを勧める。米帝は朝鮮半島への日帝の拡張主義を最初に承認どころか推奨した西洋国となった。ここでもまた「西洋を追い掛ける東洋」と云う、西洋にとって心地の良い蜃気楼が働いていた。　西洋化・キリスト教化された「ニュー・チャイナ」の蜃気楼は、孫文の支援者で、米国で教育を受けたメソジスト牧師のチャーリー宋（宋嘉澍）とその三人の娘（宋家の三姉妹）を通じて更に強化されることになる。長女の宋靄齢（孫文夫人の宋慶齢と蒋介石夫人の宋美齢の姉）と蒋介石の結託の結果生み出された軍事政権は、米国市民の世論を誘導する為にハーヴァード卒で流暢な英語を話すT.V.宗（宋子文）を送り出し、彼が米国内で作り出した強大な「チャイナ・ロビー」が、「キリスト教徒で自由と民主主義を愛する偉大な指導者で中国4億人の希望の星」なる、凡そ実像とは懸け離れた蒋介石像を広め、実際に中国民衆の支持を得ているのも日帝侵略軍と戦っているのも毛沢東の方だと云う現実を米国人の目から覆い隠した。現実の中国農民の実像とは懸け離れたパール・バックの小説『大地』が、「我が国の農民と何等変わらない、キリスト教徒ではないがキリスト教徒同然の、西洋的理想を追い求める高貴な中国農民」の蜃気楼を広め、中国への宣教師の息子ヘンリー・ルースの『タイム』等のメディア帝国が、これらの架空の中国像を増幅させた。　”The First Wise Man”ことヘンリー・スティムソンを筆頭として、ハーヴァード大卒の中国へは行ったことも無い国務省の「ワイズメン」界隈は、チャイナ・ロビーのプロパガンダを真に受けて次々に取り込まれ、どんどん誤った国際認識を育てて行った。蒋介石がファシストの詐欺師に過ぎないことを指摘しようとした中国通は次々と黙殺または排斥される憂き目に遭い、チャイナ・ロビーは「日帝との武器取引を止め、蒋介石に軍事的・経済的に支援しさえすれば、日帝の報復を恐れること無く、中国人達を助けることが出来る」と云う、米帝にとっても壊滅的な蜃気楼を信じるに至った。　「祖父を通じて、自分は中国を多少は知っている」と思い込んでいたFDRやハル国務長官の様な一部の高官達はそれでも石油の禁輸を行えば日帝との開戦は避けられないことを予測して慎重な路線を選んでいたのだが、「右手のやっていることを左手には知らせない」と云うFDRの（祖父から受け継いだ）二枚舌政治が裏目に出ることになる。チャイナ・ロビーのプロパガンダをその儘なぞったワイズメンはFDRの対中国政策に対して度々叛乱を仕掛け、その度に大火になる度に鎮圧されていた訳だが、1941年当時国務次官補だったディーン・アチソンが到頭FDRがチャーチルと密会している間にそれに成功し、実質的に日本に対する石油の禁輸を成功させた。日本を資源不足に追い込んだABCD包囲網の解釈については今でも議論が絶えないが、「米帝の石油の禁輸措置はFDRの意に反して行われた（しかもFDRは暫くその事実に気が付かなかった）」と云う点は興味深い。ブラッドレーは本書で「日帝との戦争は我が国にとって全く無用のものであり、回避出来たものだ」とする説を採用し、説得力の有る解説を試みている。　同じ様に毛沢東に関する無理解が、軍産複合体の強大化を招くことになる朝鮮戦争を開始させ（DPRKや中国の方から戦争を始めた訳ではない）、ホー・チ・ミンに対する無理解が、同じく壊滅的な結果を招いたヴェトナム戦争を始めさせることになった。また毛沢東を支援しなかったことは結果的に抗日戦争を長引かせ、蒋介石に対する支援を継続したことは結果的に抗日戦争時代よりも更に血生臭い、これまた全く無用で避けられた筈の内戦で中国全土を引き裂くことになった。米帝の無知と傲慢が如何にアジア諸国に数々の惨劇を引き起こして来たのか、ブラッドレーが活写するその愚か過ぎる内幕には呆れ果てる他無い。　無知な者の善意と悪意は屢々区別が容易ではないが、本書は基本的に「アメリカ人は善意だが無知で傲慢であるが故に過った」と云うスタンスで書かれている。だがそこに本当に明白な悪意と呼べる様なものは無かったのだろうかと少し疑問に思う。特に蒋介石と毛沢東関連の事柄についてはもっと触れられていない裏事情が有ったのではないかと憶測を巡らせたくなる。ブラッドレーの記述に寄れば、嘘の根源は宋靄齢=蒋介石であって、米国人達はひたすら騙されていただけだ、と云うことになっているが、後年のCIAの中国共産党デマの数々は米国人が意図的に作り出した嘘だ。今の例で言えばウイグルのジェノサイドだの香港の民主化弾圧だの台湾への軍事的圧力だのチベット弾圧だの南シナ海での軍事的挑発行動だの一帯一路構想に於ける「債務の罠」だの、まぁ一般市民は単に無知だから騙されているだけなのだろうが、こうしたデマや歪曲情報を広めている連中は自分達が嘘を吐いていると自覚している筈だ。第二次大戦前にも同様の秘密工作は行われていなかったのだろうか。また1930年代に行き詰まった資本主義を共産主義た高まる一方の労働者の抗議から救済する策としてファシズムがもてはやされ、欧米各国で強硬な全体主義的政策が採用された訳だが（米帝でも労働者の抗議行動の弾圧は屢々暴力的だった）、果たしてこれは共時的な偶然だったのだろうか。蒋介石は明らかにファシスト陣営、親資本主義陣営の人間だが、本書では扱われていない彼に対してウォール街や大企業はどう動いていたのだろうか。西洋各国に於ける反共主義の苛烈さを考えると、毛沢東に関する意図的な世論誘導等は行われていなかったのだろうか。深読みをし過ぎるとまぁ所謂「陰謀史観」に堕してしまう訳だけれども、本書は些かその点で被害者史観で満足してしまっている印象を受ける。残された宿題がまだまだ有りそうな気がする。","报告","","","1 个人发现此评论有用","","","",""

The world could be very different now if some key decisions had not been made by senior US politicians and diplomats lacking in knowledge and experience of the Japanese and Chinese cultures, including scandalous secret decisions made by both Roosevelts. It's not a heavy read and almost like a historical detective or expose story, not a turgid read!

"recluse","3.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","いつも変わらない「誤解」の構図","2015年6月29日 在日本审核","已确认购买","最近どういうわけかこの種の本が目立ちます。「the hundred year marathon」もそうでした。このまま中国に飲み込まれてはまずいというアメリカの一種の防衛本能がなせる自然現象なのかもしれません。ただどの作品もどうも中身の深さには欠けるようです。この作品もそうです。「無知な」アメリカ人が中国の宣伝（アメリカ化とキリスト教化のプロセスの途上にある中国）と第５列に操られてしまうという構図への恐怖感は決して目新しいものではありません 。注意深く読み直せば、「The best and the brightest」や「stillwell and american experiences in china」「In our own images」などの作品も、アジアの現実を知らずに実行されたアメリカの対アジア（対中国、フィリピン）への痛烈な批判という視点から描かれた作品です。本書もその流れから大きくずれるところはありません。ただいくつかの特色を将来の読者の方のために挙げてみましょう。まず第一に、著者はアメリカのアジア政策の原点に麻薬貿易と宣教師の関わりを指摘しています。この俗と聖との奇妙な関わりにこそアメリカのアジアへの関わりの原点があるという指摘は興味深いものです。断片的にはどちらも指摘されてきたポイントですが、この両者の併存こそが、アメリカのアジアへの関わりに、独特のダイナミックスと腐臭を与えているのです。この宣教師的な世界観はアメリカの建国神話と生存にもかかわる興味深い論点です。本書にいくつか掲載された奇妙な写真や絵はそのいい証拠でもあります。ただ悲しいかなこの論点はそれ以上深められることはありません。第２に、この聖と俗の奇妙な混合はいつも中国側にopportunisticな形で利用されてしまうという点です。その担い手でもあるchina lobbyは宋姉妹のアメリカ仕込みの英語を利用したみごとな操作により、アメリカの政官財学を巻き込んで米国の対外政策と米国での世論形成に強力な影響力を持ったわけです。このプロセスが克明にたどられています。このchina lobbyは一方に存在する「対日宥和派」との長い抗争をへて最後はsabotageという形で対日戦のきっかけを作り出したという視点はユニークな視点です。FDRもhullもこの構図の中では決して対日強硬派ではなかったのです。でもchina lobbyもそして最後はchina lobbyの切り捨てによって毛沢東に指導された中国共産党へとシフトしようとした米国務省内の中国専門家のどちらも「夷をもって夷を制す」を基本方針としていた中国に操られる存在でしか過ぎないのです。そして中国の泥沼に吸い込まれ消耗し、「戦う必要のなかった戦争」に乗り出した日本もその例外ではありません。いうまでもなく本書は学術書ではありません。専門家ではない著者が様々な二次並びに一次資料を渉猟して作り上げたストーリーラインです。著者が狙いとしたtheodoreとfranklin rooseveltの二人を通して米国と日中の関わりを描くという狙いは究極的にはうまくいかなかったようですが、米国とアジアの関わりの原型をもう一度アメリカの読者に「思い出させた」という意味では出るべくして出た作品なのでしょうか。","报告","","","5 个人发现此评论有用","","","",""
