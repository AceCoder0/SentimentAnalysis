"A. Menon","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Very insightful perspective on the political strategy of the CCP through time","2021年9月3日 在美国审核","已确认购买","This book is a well timed publication and a very useful resource to think about China's foreign policy strategy and its ultimate view on the changing nature of the global power distribution.  There has been a marked deterioration of relations between China and the US that is finding itself very difficult, if not impossible to change course.  The global pandemic has worsened relations and shown how the different systems are responding to a changing world in very different ways.  Aggressive regulatory changes in China as well have damaged foreign investments and shown China to be increasingly insular with respect to funding its investment needs and all of these issues can be better understood through this latest book by Rush Doshi.The approach of The Long Game is quite novel.  The author, through party publications, pieces together what he sees as China's foreign policy intentions and in particular the parties strategy and goals with regards to rivalry with the US.  The author argues that China has always had a long term strategy with respect to its foreign policy ambitions with the US which started out as China biding its time as it built up its strength to now being more assertive as it views the US to be in visible decline.  The author highlights how there has been a coherence to China's strategy through the similarities of Chinese leaders speeches and that Xi is continuing a tradition not breaking into a new paradigm.  The author brings up concepts like asymmetric strategies where China focused on blunting US power earlier rather than projecting its own by using lower cost strategies which effectively caused the opponent to spend poorly.  The author now advocates the US take this cue themself and focus on blunting China rather than projecting its power explicitly.  The author frames the discussion of the China naval strategy in this context.The author also highlights how the party saw the financial crisis as the event which indicated the decline of US power and the opportunity for China to assert itself with a weakened rival.  The author highlights how China's institution building has been a calculated exercise to reconstruct regional institutions around their interests and driven by their political goals.  In particular the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank and One Belt One Road initiative are discussed at length.  The Chinese obstinance on any western generated institution building exercise is also discussed and framed in terms of China's blunting strategy.  The author spends a lot of time trying to give a picture of how Chinese policy makers see the world and the unfair balance that comes from US hegemony given that they increasingly view their sphere of influence as being trampled, while of course the US would frame the situation as entirely reversed.  One does get a fair perspective on how US actions are seen to be driven by self interest rather than by some set of ideals, which is how US foreign policy is often framed (which is increasingly unconvincing).Overall the Long Game provides insight that makes sense of the transition of the China, US relationship.  That gives some ability to deduce that frictions will remain structural and the regional and global rivalry between the US and China will likely continue to increase as a new balance is formed.  Furthermore one gets a sense that the divergence between systems is getting more entrenched rather than reversionary as China increasingly views their system as a superior substitute to a decaying Western Liberalism which is decaying from within.  The book also gives some strategic perspective on how to approach China and how  it will be a difficult counterparty to satisfy.  Much of recent events can be understood better as part of a strategic game, both economic and political, that is currently being played.  For that reason alone this is a valuable book to have read.","5 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB09PWZH6W6%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_arp_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26csrfT%3DhF9uI6FujYvUg0%252FzhTO14DuOxRu0JRAifZ1Ers1nM5QUAAAAAGQvxUQAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR8XDLRHPE7URZ&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hF9uI6FujYvUg0%2FzhTO14DuOxRu0JRAifZ1Ers1nM5QUAAAAAGQvxUQAAAAB&reviewId=R8XDLRHPE7URZ","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

"Moorthy Muthuswamy","4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","The American Mantra of Democracy Promotion Abroad is Just not Going to Fly","2021年7月8日 在美国审核","已确认购买","China is an incredibly lucky country, and deservedly so. The basis of modern wealth creation, industrial manufacturing processes, which can take many decades to master, was handed over to China when the Western countries set up shop there. This scenario has had an unfortunate consequence for America, resulting in a tremendous decrease in the percentage of the population employed in industry. And for China, it went in the opposite direction. Admittedly, China lags behind America in high-end manufacturing, but not for long, given its patent acquisition and scientific publishing pace.Thanks to the author, one learns fascinating new insights about China’s rise and its grand strategy to “displace” America. The communist party, we understand, was a vehicle for China’s nationalist aspirations. But its leaders are not about to kick the ladder away.The author notes that America survived four waves of declinism only to emerge stronger. During the first three waves, America still had a large percentage of the population employed in the industrial sector. Although the fourth wave saw reduced employment levels in the sector, according to the author, America’s mastery of information technology helped its reemergence.There is concern that America has become less than enterprising in dealing with debilitating challenges such as the one posed by violent Islamists. America’s “War on Terror” has already cost over five trillion dollars by some estimates, with no end in sight, whereas China is attempting to divest Islamist ideology of its Uygur minorities and ""integrate"" them through “illiberal” tactics.As pointed out by the author, America is in the middle of its fifth wave of declinism. He is right not to write America off, just as one should not write China off in its quest either. In the long run, this competition may come down to the wealth differential between the two.I think the author failed to appreciate what the China “model” of civilizational progress entails. Under the authoritarian communism, China homogenized the society, fed its people, and educated them well, and when the manufacturing opportunity came, China was ready. In comparison, under democracy, the equally populous India has largely failed to do the above, including achieving a solid and diverse economic growth, and is now beset by divisions and insurgencies thanks to a heterogeneous society.China is likely to become more democratized regardless of the ruling regimes’ restraining attempts if history is any indication. It is only natural that the empowered people want to have a say in how they are being governed. We have seen this happen in Taiwan, South Korea, and Singapore, which achieved sustained wealth creation under authoritarian regimes and, much later, became functional democracies.It is important to grasp that achieving a functional democracy from the ground up requires more than free elections; it requires sustained wealth creation first. This may be a tough pill to swallow: increasingly, the American mantra of democracy promotion abroad is just not going to fly, and China is succeeding in talking up its model – you only have to read what the prime minister, Imran Khan, of Pakistan said on July 3, 2021.Well, the author has helped me find a front seat to witness this fascinating competition.","79 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB09PWZH6W6%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_arp_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26csrfT%3DhNqqYUJIUKvEy2HRSqVSeIdegX8LYYRxTc4L0c4jgREaAAAAAGQvxUQAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR2RFU35CAGY248&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hNqqYUJIUKvEy2HRSqVSeIdegX8LYYRxTc4L0c4jgREaAAAAAGQvxUQAAAAB&reviewId=R2RFU35CAGY248","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
"wsmrer","3.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Race or Boxing Match?","2021年7月16日 在美国审核","已确认购买","The CCP files have been digitalized Rush Doshi at Yale and Brookings has labored through the ponderous task of perusal and tells us what ‘they’ think and ‘his’ response in the coming battle for who is to rule (Hegemony) making suggested damaging policy responses. Chinese theorist Yan Xiaotong describes it: ‘A race not a boxing match.’ Doshi describes the latter, or worse. *The Long Game is a very entertaining read in some ways, for the young Chinese scholars have with amazing insight unraveled the forty year demise of America’s Wonderment to now the troubling conditions of America’s Quandary in finding itself again. That search by Ludwig von Mises, Milton Freedman, and Robert Bork for the “Free Market” of Neoliberalism, resulted in reducing ‘Industrial Production’ to ‘Financial Assets,’ the collapse of the Great Recession, and a damaged Middle Class watching the soaring returns of the 1%’ers. They also understand the rise of Populism, our political fracturing, and estimate it to continuing for a decade. They describe current times accurately; our own academics often less well. “Know the Other —Sun Tzu.”Doshi is disconnected from China as it is, hung up on ideology. He misses China current antagonisms and setbacks – the existing departures from Xi Jinping’s ‘Dream’ mostly unmentioned.There is little contact with what has happened in the day to day efforts of CCP’s leadership to broaden its influence among other nations and setbacks that have been frequent, but that diminishes ‘the threat of Chinese dominance’ so no surprise. **Doshi’s concluding What Must Be Done has little to offer on rebuilding infrastructure, and retooling the role of government to promote education, health, enviormrnt and social stability currently on Biden’s policy table, but the M-I-C crowd will be greatly pleased if Rush Doshi taken seriously.China sees America in demise, themselves on the road to preeminence at 2049 -- the Centennial of the Peoples’ Republic.America may be ‘Reformed,’ as many current policy advocates desire, that would reinstall our liberal leadership role and make the coming contest interesting, moving some institutions to meet the changing world; or the projected ‘loss 10 years’ of the young scholars; we’ll see? Conflict will help neither.A mixed bag.3 Stars*Ronan Farrow, in his War on Peace: The End of Diplomacy and the Decline of American Influence, argues that diplomacy is not State Department generated now the power has shifted to the Pentagon, and inner workings of National Security sectors – Doshi’s plans are so designed.**See: How China Loses: The Pushback against Chinese Global Ambitions by Luke Patey describing sever setbacks in developing nations.China's Western Horizon: Beijing and the New Geopolitics of Eurasia by Daniel Markey mentions bombing of C. engineers’ buses as occurred 7/15/21 again in Pakistan – BRI not an easy go anywhere.The Epic Split – Why ‘Made in China’ is going out of style by Johan Nylander, as China losses 40,000 factory a year due to rising cost to other low cost countries.","15 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB09PWZH6W6%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_arp_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26csrfT%3DhJH3Sy%252FzwXYzAVZmCBqbbgzXb7cFVrt1VsB4TVgd6mVWAAAAAGQvxUQAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR31VJ7WBNJXAHR&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hJH3Sy%2FzwXYzAVZmCBqbbgzXb7cFVrt1VsB4TVgd6mVWAAAAAGQvxUQAAAAB&reviewId=R31VJ7WBNJXAHR","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
"Loyd Eskildson","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Excellent Background on China's Long-Term Strategy","2021年7月21日 在美国审核","已确认购买","I already had been impressed by how coherent and effective current Chinese strategy is - working its way up the economic value chain, improving first the education of K-12 pupils in coastal areas - then expanding that slowly into the interior while also rapidly building its colleges and universities. All after first having learned basic management and technical skills via foreign investment.However, I'd assumed China's strategy had evolved over time. Details - 'Yes,' but the overall strategy for at least the next half-century was there from the very beginning.What do we do know? China already had a much stronger K-12 education system, is building its tertiary education system, and has large numbers of expatriates who have also developed top-level technical skills/expertise within the U.S. and other nations. Meanwhile, biases against Asians and various sanctions and prohibitions against buying Chinese products and selling high-tech products to China have undoubtedly redoubled its resolve to press onward into dominating A.I. etc. A dangerous 'downside' now is that the U.S. may put China into a corner where it cannot adequately employ its increasingly high-tech workforce without support from Taiwan and its world-leading TSMC.","5 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB09PWZH6W6%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_arp_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26csrfT%3DhEsp9M4PO0IqD4l6e57%252BjTo5hM2q2vOmSWGq0q21iP8VAAAAAGQvxUQAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR1VS4LUIMVQU79&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hEsp9M4PO0IqD4l6e57%2BjTo5hM2q2vOmSWGq0q21iP8VAAAAAGQvxUQAAAAB&reviewId=R1VS4LUIMVQU79","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
"Christine DelVecchio","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","To understand why China is a threat and what the US can do to counter it, read this book.","2021年10月10日 在美国审核","已确认购买","I found Rush Doshi’s The Long Game: China’s Grand Strategy to Displace American Order fascinating as well as informative.  I’m no scholar of China or political strategy, yet I found his book to be very readable.He introduces topics using anecdotes that interest and illuminate.  For example, I found captivating his account of China’s clandestine purchase of a Ukrainian aircraft carrier, taking over 7 years to accomplish, costing tens of millions (in US dollars) including bribes, villas and casinos, and involving one basketball player.  This narrative illustrated how China in the 1990’s built up its military while hiding that effort.Doshi’s book is up-to-date.  He discusses how China perceives US weakness in dealing with the pandemic.  China’s response is to be emboldened.  Just look at last week’s events: China flying more than 100 jets over Taiwan as a show of strength.Doshi is organized and methodical. He makes a very convincing case that China is working towards displacing American liberal systems with their illiberal system.  He reviews different approaches to countering China’s ambitions and is persuasive that an asymmetric option is safest, least costly, and effective. If you want to understand why China is a threat and what the US and its allies can do to counter it, read this book.","4 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB09PWZH6W6%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_arp_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26csrfT%3DhHgNNfF5D0ioXkrPh7ERLopHrtQGfOn3EocYJgdZDP%252BZAAAAAGQvxUQAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR2Y7BMUYO12VHP&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hHgNNfF5D0ioXkrPh7ERLopHrtQGfOn3EocYJgdZDP%2BZAAAAAGQvxUQAAAAB&reviewId=R2Y7BMUYO12VHP","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
"IY1967","2.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","The correct title for this book should be American's vision on China's grand strategy","2021年8月14日 在美国审核","已确认购买","If you want to understand what is China's grand strategy, if any, from this book, you will probably be disappointed. The shortcomings of this book is the lacking of real data but relying on author's understanding of Chinese documents to deduce China's grand strategy. No doubt, China has its only policy in dealing with US but if the author knows the word ""propaganda"", then he should not put too much focus on some word counts (like the one in Figure 11.1 in the book).Besides, discussing ""grand strategy"" should go with discussing economic power of a country. If the author could research China GDP from 1970 to 2020, he would understand why China did not directly make a head to head race instead of ""blunting"" US in 80s to 90s. The truth is China did not have enough economic strength to deal with US or any other western powers in those eras. This is the major flaw of this book and all other arguments failed accordingly.Another failed argument of this book is related to why China delaying carriers development in 90s. To make it clear, the argument of this book does not base on technology or economic sense. The author just based on his own subjective speculations. China is never a strong ship building country in 80s even until today. The strongest players in this field in Asia is South Korea and Japan. And China has no technology lead in making fighter jets or steam catapult. To conclude, it is not China did not make carrier but it just simply cannot make it.There are numerous examples in this book showing the author's superficial knowledge on China. The only pros of this book is that it shows how incompetent of US understands China. If US relies on such low level think tank to develop its strategy to deal with China, US is doomed to failed in Sino-US relationship.I got this book by 9.99, but I think this book just worth 0.99.","56 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB09PWZH6W6%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_arp_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26csrfT%3DhFgw2uV93f9IC%252FOBmqWE%252BOqjeiFjcHUYWUYmmvF%252BL83lAAAAAGQvxUQAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR7P6J3OHCKTBC&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hFgw2uV93f9IC%2FOBmqWE%2BOqjeiFjcHUYWUYmmvF%2BL83lAAAAAGQvxUQAAAAB&reviewId=R7P6J3OHCKTBC","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

"Clifford Nelson","1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Obviously an extremely biased viewpoint","2023年3月19日 在美国审核","","When you talk about how the US is always a positive force in the world and refuse to accept that others do not agree, there is no question that it is biased. The US has so many problems. and it does not really practice what it preaches. Its aim is obviously maintaining global hegemony and not anything altruistic, and it always never listens to other countries concerns about its aims. Listening is something the US cannot do, and it tries to force its flawed system on other countries. What the US excels at is having the highest incarceration rate in the world, spending more of its GDP on medical without descent medical. The  US is not a democracy in the strict sense and that seems to be forgotten. What is even worse is that the rich control the country as proven by a study done by princeton which is a big reason that the rich are so rich in the country while the middle class is declining, there are so many homeless, and the poverty rate is 17.8% vs 0.6 percent according to both the World Bank and CIA. China has responded the way it has because it recognized that the US is a threat because if the GDP per capita of Chinese reaches that of Japan, Taiwan, or South Korea, then the Chinese GDP would be twice the United States and the GDP PPP would be much higher. That would ruin American economic global political hegemony which eventually would destroy its political hegemony. There has been a lot of wisdom behind the leadership of China, and it recognizes that the US will not accept a successful China--it will do everything it can to destroy China since only an impoverished China would not be a threat to American hegemony.","报告","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB09PWZH6W6%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhLrg28nY376naDLUTugKmEA4KsyI1QwNWYzfO44XoHf3AAAAAGQvxV4AAAAB%26reviewId%3DR3F82JOL6NR7N4&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","显示条评论","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hLrg28nY376naDLUTugKmEA4KsyI1QwNWYzfO44XoHf3AAAAAGQvxV4AAAAB&reviewId=R3F82JOL6NR7N4","","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

"K. Dekleva","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","An excellent and thought-provoking book by Dr Rush Doshi","2021年9月24日 在美国审核","","This is the latest in series of excellent books (see also Jonathan Ward, Peter Martin, and Michael Pillsbury) about China’s rise and long-term strategy to achieve its dream of rejuvenation by 2049.  Dr Doshi knows his subject and takes the reader through China’s evolving strategy since 1972.  The author skillfully weaves the dialogue, drawing on multiple Chinese sources.  He sees the strategy as less about Xi per se, and more about the CCP.  But Xi has been a clear and forceful accelerant with respect to China’s recent aggressive military, diplomatic, and intelligence initiatives.

"Peter T. Wolf","3.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","But where's the military component ?","2021年8月10日 在美国审核","","The author writes a thorough summary of how (and why) China arrived at this point. But the remedies he offers for the U.S. conspicuously omits THE one thing dictatirships most fear: An unbeatable military. Five thousand years of history confirm this. It is why China itself is racing towards military  superpower status. Including nukes. Beijing isn't  just relying on economic hegemony or ""soft power"".  So why has the author ignored the obvious need for a stronger American military ?  Because it doesn't fit the narrative of the progressive wing of the political party he's a member of.","4 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB09PWZH6W6%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhJZo76Pg7vCZPJcLWkmCeDVrnis2vQ8D1Y2TUBmURsbDAAAAAGQvxV8AAAAB%26reviewId%3DR2CU2Q34BITGI7&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hJZo76Pg7vCZPJcLWkmCeDVrnis2vQ8D1Y2TUBmURsbDAAAAAGQvxV8AAAAB&reviewId=R2CU2Q34BITGI7","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

I suppose that is his intention, to document ad nauseum, but he does not compensate with much analytical insight that is novel or additive.  Also, I have yet to see any on the ground reporting or even interviews with Chinese officials...with the proviso I noted above.","5 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB09PWZH6W6%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhCT4Otyh5aeVawXlyF8m4tfwMK3olb0%252F22iV9gdCBum8AAAAAGQvxV8AAAAB%26reviewId%3DR14URON4NFTH8L&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hCT4Otyh5aeVawXlyF8m4tfwMK3olb0%2F22iV9gdCBum8AAAAAGQvxV8AAAAB&reviewId=R14URON4NFTH8L","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

I, nonetheless, have had an ageless fascination with history since early childhood. I voraciously try to obtain resources on topics for which I am deficient.  China and the workings of its 21st-century rise are examples.I purchased and read this book to help contextualize many of the names (e.g. Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin, Hu Jintao, Xi Jinping) , places, and organizations (e.g. CICA, AIIB) that I have peripherally known about/of through news articles over the years.The book seems to be well-cited and presents facts and opinions in an organized manner.  While one may not fully agree with some themes throughout the book, it does present information well.In summary,  the book is an excellent primer to get one up to speed and current with geopolitical knowledge.
