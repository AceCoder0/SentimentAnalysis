"M Prywes","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Poor education could stop the Chinese miracle","2021年12月30日 在美国审核","已确认购买","Scott Rozelle is a development economist at Stanford University and Natalie Hell is a writer.  The book reports on the research of the authors and their team at Stanford’s Rural Education Action Program.  It's well-written and easy to read, considering that its substance derives from technical research.The central theme is that inadequate education constrains China’s rise from a middle- to a fully developed and upper-income country.  The book finds that education is especially weak in rural China, where 64 percent of the population lives.  The authors predict shortages of qualified labor over the next several decades.Many Americans may ask why they should care, since our leaders treat China as a rival and an unfair competitor.  The authors expect that a slow-down in China’s growth would harm both the developing and industrial countries that export to China.  For example, it would harm US exports to China (soybeans, wheat, pork).  It would harm poor countries where China sub-contracts production (Indonesia, Thailand, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Ethiopia).Slower growth would frustrate China’s youth as they enter the labor market and would sharpen inequality between the less-educated rural and the more-educated urban population.  This could provoke internal political conflict.  There's a risk that China’s leaders would respond to domestic division by inflaming nationalism, for example through military expansion.  We Americans are better-off with fat and happy than with hungry and angry rivals.  It was irrational for President Trump to think that the USA could be better off with a poorer China or Mexico.It’s difficult to see how China can continue its growth performance without heavy investment in education.  The 2015 micro-census showed that only about 30 percent of China’s labor force had a high school or higher education, putting it behind all the other middle-income countries.  The figure for the industrial (OECD) countries was 80 percent.  Only 12.5 percent had a college education.  The industrial countries are at 35 percent.  Happily, China has already started to expand university education, but building a quality university takes time.The hukou (residence permit) system has been a major cause of poor education.  Under hukou, the hundreds of millions of workers who migrated from rural villages to cities cannot send their children to free public elementary and junior high schools in the city.  If migrants bring their children with them to a city, they must pay fees to informal and poor-quality private schools.  The alternative is to for migrant workers to  separate the family and leave their spouse and children in the village, where the children can attend school for free.Many poor children can’t attend high school (grades 10 to 12) because their parents can’t afford the fees.  This is a problem in rural areas where incomes are low.  In 2010, high school attainment in the rural labor force was only 11 percent, compared to 44 percent in urban areas.  Further, there was a quality problem. Many rural high schools are vocational schools with less qualified teachers and less academic curriculums than urban schools.The incentives facing bureaucrats work against rural education.  Local authorities may not fund quality public education since most of the benefits spill-over to the urban areas.  Moreover, the benefits are realized over the long period so that local government bureaucrats are unlikely to win promotion in the near-term.A further cause of poor educational achievement is inadequate early childhood nutrition.  This harms cognitive development and children’s learning.  (I am unsure whether this finding contradict the official data, which show low rates of wasting and stunting (indicators of early childhood malnutrition).  Infection by intestinal worms is another cause of poor achievement.  The worms consume food and can leave children feeling fatigued at school.  Many school children have difficulty learns simply because they don’t receive vision tests and eyeglasses.Inadequate coverage of secondary and university education may explain the middle-income trap, in which middle-income countries cease to grow rapidly and fail to break through to high income status.These influences on education could cause China could fall into the middle-income trap.  The ‘trap’ describes the tendency for growth of per capita GDP in the middle-income countries to slow, or to cease, so that the countries fail to break through to mature into high-income countries.  The per-capita GDP of Mexico, Brazil, Turkey, and South Africa has been roughly flat for much of the past decade.  These are countries all failed to offer good-quality secondary education to their youth.In contrast, Taiwan, Korea, Ireland, and Israel were middle income countries which achieved high-income status.  All have delivered quality secondary, technical, and university education to a high proportion of their youth.  Korea built its growth strategy around delivering educated graduates to priority heavy and tech industries.  Ireland pioneered the establishment of (tertiary level) technical institutes.The authors propose the following policies improve education.  First, fund education from a central budget to counter the tendency to underfunding by local authorities. Second, offer fee-free, central government funding to secondary education to all students.  Third, reform the hukou system to allow children of migrant workers from the countryside to attend public schools in cities.  Finally, deliver health education to parents, to teach them principles of nutrition, and how to prevent intestinal worms, and the provision of glasses.","9 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB08GCZL1PT%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_arp_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26csrfT%3DhDooTQw0U2syZYk0LPUcJEvbKW0e1pDqrLtTu24bKvXDAAAAAGQvyEoAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR3P0XH98EZ4IKC&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hDooTQw0U2syZYk0LPUcJEvbKW0e1pDqrLtTu24bKvXDAAAAAGQvyEoAAAAB&reviewId=R3P0XH98EZ4IKC","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

This is an outstanding book, one that I enjoyed reading and that my students loved. Unlike many of the ""popular"" books about China, often written by people with limited, anecdotal knowledge of the country, it's based on rigorous, peer-reviewed research conducted over decades. Importantly, this doesn't mean that the book is dry or boring; to the contrary, it pairs the research with examples and stories that make the subject come to life and the issues understandable to the non-specialist and to the student. Rozelle's analysis is thoughtful at all times, acknowledging the counterarguments and everything that we don't know and can't easily predict. Rozelle also draws from the experience of other countries to help us think through possible scenarios as China attempts to make the transition to high-income country. Recommended not just to understand China better, but also to learn more about economic development and poverty reduction in general, especially in places that have escaped extreme poverty but may risk getting stuck in the ""middle-income trap.""","2 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB08GCZL1PT%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_arp_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26csrfT%3DhPpkVDJn9r6%252FC3s1q%252BkApwdr3bFT2SkCCFCboF501lXhAAAAAGQvyEoAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR1D9QA3BPUB4Q8&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hPpkVDJn9r6%2FC3s1q%2BkApwdr3bFT2SkCCFCboF501lXhAAAAAGQvyEoAAAAB&reviewId=R1D9QA3BPUB4Q8","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
"bookbuyer","4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Good but narrowly focused","2021年3月9日 在美国审核","已确认购买","The book is pretty narrowly focused on specific policy suggestions that would affect either childhood development or health, or the pre-university education system. It's not bad, but just don't expect a wider examination of rural-urban labor issues.I'm surprised the authors don't give more time to what the situation is like now for rural people that didn't receive that investment in human capital. For example most cities in China are filled with a lot of young men (but increasingly older men and some women) who deliver food for very low wages as gig workers for large startups. They're a ubiquitous sight across China and having a lot of young rural men rushing around delivery food orders for very low wages speaks to labor market issues, lack of investment in human capital, and a growing urban-rural divide. But it's not really mentioned in the book.My other criticism is that the book often compares countries that got trapped in middle income (Mexico) and countries that got out (Ireland, South Korea). But there isn't much serious comparison or analysis here. The example often seem breezily cited as evidence of the authors claims about China.","7 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB08GCZL1PT%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_arp_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26csrfT%3DhNM0yNPnyipbKtXd65IesV9rE7Zk9ju7HQ7TVFreP5QFAAAAAGQvyEoAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR3QQLQFPEDB8M0&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/-/zh/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hNM0yNPnyipbKtXd65IesV9rE7Zk9ju7HQ7TVFreP5QFAAAAAGQvyEoAAAAB&reviewId=R3QQLQFPEDB8M0","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

"Bruce Rhodes","3.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Well-written and informative, but there's a problem","2021年4月19日 在美国审核","","On the plus side, Invisible China is well-written, and its author Scott Rozelle reveals his intelligence, deep knowledge of and passion for his subject matter, i.e. China, his research subject of several decades and, more specifically, the youth of China and their welfare. I found his ‘person on the street’ anecdotes quite revealing. And I believe his conclusions about what can help the Chinese youth are valid, i.e. changes to the way infants are raised, taking steps to avoid rampant anemia, and vision care. In general, I learned a lot from reading this book.However, I was quite uncomfortable about what seems to be his willingness to downplay the harshness with which Chinese regimes, especially in the present, treat their own citizens. Beyond referring little more than once to there currently being an ‘authoritarian regime’ in China, Rozelle does not acknowledge the elephants in the room:  the mistreatment and imprisonment of the Tibetan and Uighur peoples, and dissenters in Hong Kong and elsewhere, to say nothing of the legacy of genocide, e.g. Mao letting 30 million citizens die, mostly from starvation. All of this makes me wonder if Rozelle has made an unspoken deal with the regime, whereby he ignores these relevant realities about China in exchange for being permitted to range far and wide through the country to conduct his research.On p. 177, Rozelle asks rhetorically, “Shouldn’t [I] be worrying more about the education of kids in the United States? Aren’t there babies in California who need [my] attention? Who cares about China?” Frankly, these very questions dogged me from page 1 onward. While it is hard to criticize Rozelle for wanting to improve the health and fortunes of young children, I have great difficulty with his having chosen to help a country run by what I regard as a cruel, rogue regime. Perhaps it is not an accident or an oversight that the regime has given its rural population short shrift for decades; there may be method in their ruthlessness. Their leading edge surveillance infrastructure certainly informs them, so it’s likely they’re acutely aware of the rural situation.In summary, while I’ll accept that Rozelle is not naïve, he’s failed to put all of the relevant cards from the China deck out on the table, and I suspect he’s gone this route not only out of fear of regime reprisal (as mentioned above) but also because he understands that folks like me take issue with him doing anything that will help the current Chinese regime. Full disclosure: I make every effort to boycott products made in China (and yes, its products are hard to avoid).","5 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB08GCZL1PT%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhLANnEfdWqrHHTx8VnMMFKUVe83KjHjHqR3Qlgf72L8TAAAAAGQvyGYAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR2U3Y7ZHJKLU75&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hLANnEfdWqrHHTx8VnMMFKUVe83KjHjHqR3Qlgf72L8TAAAAAGQvyGYAAAAB&reviewId=R2U3Y7ZHJKLU75","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

To my knowledge, wages have been stagnating for a while and many factories already relocated to mainland and many university graduates struggle to find good paying jobs.- The authors tend to presume because of A, it will result in B.

Checked it out at our local library.The book mostly paints a dire outlook of China's economy based upon the inelasticity of labor workforce. The author illustrated, with examples of many countries, how this is a problem especially to mid-income countries. Economics 101 tells us labor inelasticity is a problem in all economies and high-come country like US are not exempt.By the author's own account, China started addressing the problem 20 years ago in 2000 by expanding higher education capacity and making education free and mandatory up to junior-high level. It looks to me the problem would be eradicated in China in 2030-2040.US's economy has been in transition since 1990s too, with manufacturing jobs moving overseas, US has problem with labor being inelastic too. Civilian labor force participation in US has declined 4% since 2000 to pre-pandemic and another 1.5% decline since pandemic (according to US Bureau of Labor Statistic). That's people dropping out of the workforce. US is the only G7 country with declining overall labor participation since 1990s according to OECD data.

"Loyd Eskildson","2.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Very Strange Book -","2021年12月13日 在美国审核","","The author's premise is that low education levels in most of China will preclude it from getting past the Middle-Income trap. However, my understanding from reading numerous books about China is that its coastal areas (about 280 million) and less-populated areas are very different. The coastal area is very well educated, highly productive, and now has trouble finding jobs for those with college educations. China has a history of first trying out new approaches in a few limited areas (usually its coastal area) and it would make sense for it to continue such. Ergo, there will be no problem with lack of education when China further upgrades is coastal areas - scene of decades of amazing success.","报告","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB08GCZL1PT%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhNEoGzrj%252F74YjVwm9LcmeUOaJaUqdkOteMJRCcqVXK%252BmAAAAAGQvyGYAAAAB%26reviewId%3DRYDRQGDUE7JDT&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","显示条评论","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hNEoGzrj%2F74YjVwm9LcmeUOaJaUqdkOteMJRCcqVXK%2BmAAAAAGQvyGYAAAAB&reviewId=RYDRQGDUE7JDT","","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"
"Amanda Alexander","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Stunning overview of economic, health and education policies in rural China.","2020年10月23日 在美国审核","","Invisible China provides a stunning overview of economic, health and education policies in rural China. China may have one of the largest economies in the world, but it has one of the lowest levels of education. If low-skill work in construction and manufacturing slows or is replaced by automation technology, China’s emerging workforce won’t have the ability to adapt to different work or industries.As part of the Rural Education Action Program (REAP), public health researchers, economists and education specialists from universities in both the US and China mass collected data from across China. It’s an extraordinary effort in a country where credible statistics can be difficult to come by, especially in the “poor, rural interior.” Overall, their rigorous research shows that the education and well being of rural Chinese children has not kept pace with the country’s swift development and rising wages. In fact, it’s unbelievably bad.Many workers don’t know how to learn, even if they are given opportunities for advancement by their current employers. If China loses their competitive edge and cannot advance into high-value-added industries, the country will become stuck at this level – a ‘middle income trap.’This trap could cause problems with investment rates, social stability and further divert funding away from education and towards policing and welfare support.Since rural families have historically been permitted to have more children than those in the cities, China now faces the alarming possibility that the vast majority of their future workforce is malnourished, socially neglected and under educated. Although China has an elite class of workers, such as business people, engineers and programmers, they are not strong enough to support the rest of the country with universal basic income. Alongside higher wages for low skilled workers, China is now leading the world in robotics technology and is the main global customer of the robotics which are replacing those low skilled workers.Although the Chinese government has recently made moves to remedy this issue through reducing or abolishing school fees, improving access to textbooks and expanding vocational schools, there was no early investment in human capital or a well laid plan to transition the country from a manufacturing to an innovation-based economy. Unfortunately many of these problems started during the Cultural Revolution and were neglected by Deng Xiaoping. He is rightly credited with the economic miracle, but unfortunately mass education was not given priority. Now, the current leadership must implement policies that may not show positive results for a generation. It’s terribly difficult to implement policies that take so long for results. It is even more difficult if those policies must be implemented by rural leadership who feel that the benefits of those policies will only go to urban areas. According to the authors, upgrading the education level of the entire labour force would take 45 years.Each chapter provides comparative research to other countries which have fallen into or avoided the middle income trap. Thankfully, they include many simple graphs and charts to explain their economic theories. Although they recognise the difficulty in comparing China to a much smaller country, such as Ireland, it’s incredibly useful for understanding what steps could be taken now to improve the situation of China’s children. Outlining how Mexico’s growth stalled and resulted in widespread criminal activity and economic stagnation reveals how important it is to take this problem seriously. China’s rural and migrant workers are ‘invisible,’ but their welfare could impact the country’s elite and global economic stability. The authors also explain why vocational schools in Germany have been so incredibly successful, while those in China have been, for the most part, an expensive disaster. They certainly don’t discount differences in economic history or local culture, but this comparative research does show how China could reshape their policies to mimic the success of South Korea and avoid the social upheaval of Mexico.I came to this book with some background knowledge. I conducted research at a Shanghai university on the hukou system, social capital, and schools for internal migrant children. I also volunteered at migrant schools in Shanghai. The hukou system is a household registration system which divides Chinese citizens into agricultural and non-agricultural residency status. However, the problems and solutions in this book require no background knowledge in China or economics. If anything, the summaries of their arguments in each closing section are a bit too long. That may be due to their fears that even those living in China might not be able to recognise this looming problem in a population that remains invisible and separate to the elite of the mega cities.The hukou categories shape where the individual and their family can live, work, or study and what benefits or services they can receive. More than 70% of China’s children have rural status. Many internal migrant parents face a difficult choice of staying in their rural hometowns in poverty, leaving their children behind in the care of others, or bringing their children to cities where they will be unable to access proper health and education services. Even parents who are able to keep their children in local schools might find that corruption and incompetence leaves their children far behind urban children.The human suffering outlined in these chapters was almost impossible to read without setting the book down for a moment. Many of the recommended actions and policies are surely within the ability of the Chinese government, but they describe how education in China is fairly decentralised. Although this situation was only briefly described, higher levels of government could take harsh action against those unscrupulous individuals in rural areas who set up Potemkin schools. These “schools” take education funding meant for China’s poorest students but have no teachers or students. Each chapter includes a very human story, such as descriptions of job fairs, adult workers struggling without general education skills, young students unable to see the blackboard because their caretakers think glasses will ruin their eyes, children too weak to play because of anaemia and worms, young girls blocked by their families from taking parasite-killing medication in case it harms their fertility, young men looking into bride kidnapping as a source of income and babies failing intelligence tests before they are anywhere near a school. It is a moving and sobering read, but not without hope. Every section describes crushing poverty, ignorance and corruption, but the authors provide just as many solutions.There was only one section that I wish the authors had expanded on. In describing how the hukou system prevents rural children from attending urban schools and hospitals, the solution was to abolish the system and to implement policies similar to Taiwan. Why the hukou system is still in use or what justification the government provides for it was not presented and this leaves the reader wondering how lifting these restrictions would work in practice. Would urban schools and hospitals maintain their quality if class sizes and hospital waiting times skyrocketed? Unfortunately this policy recommendation was a little thin compared to more pragmatic steps of providing parenting classes and opticians. That said, I’m sure other texts have studied the hukou system in full and overall this is an important book that provides a clear call to action.The first challenge this book faces is convincing the reader and government authorities that China’s children are indeed suffering terribly. This is hard to imagine for those who associate Chinese cities with top international education rankings and tiger mothers. For those travelling by plane or high speed train across China’s rural areas, it’s difficult to see that many of China’s children are suffering from health problems (especially invisible health problems), social isolation and a lack of education. Despite the best efforts of the government to provide funding, many families face an issue with the opportunity cost of staying in school. Many families know that their children are not receiving a good education in the their local schools and could make a small fortune by dropping out of school to work in construction, even if it means lying about their age. China has one of the highest male-female sex imbalances in the world due to sex-selective abortions. If there is an economic downturn, many young men who are unable to find work or partners may turn to gang activity and organised crime. The authors take pains here to explain that employment also provides self-respect and a sense of connection to the community. The second challenge for this book is that it may have trouble distinguishing itself from the numerous other books out there arguing that China isn’t as great as everyone thinks. This would be a shame, as Invisible China is based on careful research and makes persuasive policy arguments for improving the situation of Chinese children and avoiding the middle income trap.This book was provided by the publisher for review.","13 个人发现此评论有用","https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB08GCZL1PT%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_getr_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26reviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26pageSize%3D10%26csrfT%3DhOcXuMjmCthQZvEJ4%252FgGuFfhVvldjg%252BlqeMViRRB0i7LAAAAAGQvyGYAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR3SJK8N0OBQWL6&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=zh&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0","有帮助","报告","https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hOcXuMjmCthQZvEJ4%2FgGuFfhVvldjg%2BlqeMViRRB0i7LAAAAAGQvyGYAAAAB&reviewId=R3SJK8N0OBQWL6","显示条评论","0","当前加载评论时遇到问题。请稍后再试。"

Economist誌が毎年発表している「今年の読むべき本」にリストアップされていたので読んでみたもの。【中所得国の罠】経済成長の波に乗って、それまで好調に推移してきた低開発国の経済が、その所得が1万ドル近辺に達した途端、それまでの高度経済成長が終焉して、一転して経済が不調に転じ、なかなか成長の軌道に復帰できないことを「中所得国の罠」と呼ぶが、このままでは中国は間違いなくこと罠にはまると本書は警告する。中国の経済成長は、低賃金を武器に単純労働（農業、漁業のような一次経済や、低付加価値の製品の製造や建設作業のような肉体労働）を世界中から取り込むことによって実現した。こうした労働は、農村部から都市部に労働人口が移動することによって支えられていたが、中国の場合、この農村部の余剰人口は非常に多かった為、この人口移動が非常に大規模で、かつ長期間に渡って続いた為、いわゆる「ルイスの転換点（農村部の余剰人口が枯渇し、都市部の労働賃金上昇が始まること）」がなかなか到来しなかったが、2005年に、ついにこの労働賃金の上昇が中国でも始まった。労働賃金の上昇が始まると、もはや中国は今までのように海外からの投資を吸引し続けることは出来ない。むしろ海外資本は中国から資本を引きあげ、より賃金が安く労働の質が良い別の国に工場を移すようになる。そうなると中国の工場労働者は失業を余儀なくされる。都市での仕事がなくなっても、中国の労働者は出身地の農村部に戻る（Ｉターン）ことが出来ない。中国農民の一人当たり農地面積は非常に小さく、農業は基本的に儲からない構造になっている。単純労働のもうひとつの吸収先が建設作業だが、これもインフラ工事の飽和により、今までのような工事の拡大が見込めなくなった。起死回生の措置として導入された一帯一路も、「労働者を中国から連れてくるとは何事だ」と反発する国も多く、思うように進んでいない。【見えない中国（Ｉｎｖｉｓｉｂｌｅ　Ｃｈｉｎａ）】中国というと、国内を縦横に走る新幹線、高速道路や都市に林立する高層ビルを連想しがちだが、こうした経済成長の成果を誇示するようなVisible Chinaの陰で、発展から取り残されたInvisible Chinaが存在する。中国の地方農村部や山間部の村落である。こうした発展から取り残された地域に外国人が足を踏み入れることは、ほとんどない。しかし、中国の人口の65％強は今でも農村部に存在し、都市人口は全体の35％弱に過ぎない。このInvisible Chinaを制度的に固定する、世界でも稀なひどい制度が中国には存在する。戸籍制度（戸口制度、Hukou）である。中国では都市戸籍と農村戸籍が厳格に区別され、今でもこの戸籍の壁を越えて農村から都市に戸籍を移すことは非常に難しい。大量の労働者が農村部から都市に出稼ぎに出ているが、こうした農村部に戸籍を持つ労働者は、病院も、また家族の教育も、本来の戸籍地以外で受けることは出来ない。だから出稼ぎ労働者は子弟を故郷の親戚に預けて、長期間離れ離れで暮らすか、費用が高い割には質の低い都市部の私立学校に子どもを入れるしか選択肢が無い。農村戸籍を持つ家庭の子女は、そのスタート地点から、良質の公共教育を受ける道を閉ざされている。中国の大学新卒者は（大学の定義によるが）、毎年1500万人～2000万人いる。これだけでもすごい数字だが、更に欧米の大学・大学院に大量の留学生を送り出している。問題は、これらはすべて基本的には都市戸籍の子弟で、農村戸籍の子弟には、こうした高学歴への階梯は、初めから閉ざされているところにある。それは進学率に表れていて、中国の大学進学率は15％。高卒以上でも30％である。諸外国の経験では、高卒以上の進学率を最低でも50％にまで引き上げないと、中所得国の罠にはまるとされている。なぜ、そうなるのか。メキシコを例に説明しよう。【メキシコの事例】1990年代はメキシコにとって黄金の時代だった。アメリカとの国境沿いに展開したマキラドーラ地区に世界中から資本が殺到し、メキシコの高度経済成長が始まった。NAFTAの加盟が、この高度経済成長を加速させた。当時のメキシコ大統領は誇らしげに語った。「メキシコはManana（明日）の国である」と。ところが2000年を境にメキシコの高度成長に急ブレーキがかかる。中国がWTOに加盟し、大量の工場がメキシコから中国へ移転したことが大きいが、最大の問題は、メキシコが、より高度な産業構造にシフトすることに必要な人材（Human capital）の育成に失敗したことである。今でもそうだが、メキシコは非常な格差社会で、所得格差は教育格差に直結し、大量の単純労働従事者は輩出できても、より高度な判断を日常的に必要とする高卒以上の学歴を持つ人材の育成に失敗した。これがメキシコの産業構造の高度化を阻害した最大の要因で、単純労働に従事する労働者が中国労働者との競争に敗退すると、彼らを吸収する雇用先をメキシコ国内に見つけることは不可能になった。こうしてメキシコの先進国への仲間入りの夢は潰えた。希望が失われると、社会が不安定化し、治安が悪化した。失業した労働者を吸収したのが麻薬取引を行う反社会的勢力だったことが治安悪化を加速した。似たようなことはブラジルでも起きた。いずれの場合も、中所得国の罠に陥った最大の原因は、教育の普及の失敗が引き起こした人材育成の失敗だったと我々は見ている。【中国の見えない壁（Invisible Barriers）】李克強首相が「中国には月収千元（15000人）の人々が6億人いる」と述べたが、中国の農村部を詳しく調査すると、中国が、将来に備えて人材育成を行うことが非常に難しい困難な道であることが見えてくる。第一の壁が、中国では非常に多くの幼児が栄養失調状態にあるという紛れもない事実である。一見、どの子も丸々と太り、栄養が行き渡っているように見える。やせ衰えた、見た目に明らかな栄養失調の子供は、もはや中国の農村部にも、ほぼ全く存在しない。しかし、詳しく調査すると、その子供たちの多くが貧血状態（鉄分不足）に陥っていることが判明する。確かにカロリーは行き渡っている。コメや饅頭を大量に子供たちは摂取しているのは糖質ばかりで、鉄分をはじめとするビタミンなどの栄養素は、実は貧困地域に行けば行くほど摂取が十分ではない。幼少期、長期に渡って貧血状態が続くと、脳の発達が阻害されることが既に明らかになっている。この問題はサプリメントを供給すれば、たちどころに解決するのだが、中国の農村部では、サプリメントを忌避する傾向が顕著だ。第二の壁が、寄生虫（回虫）の蔓延だ。中国では、時に南部では回虫にほとんどの人間が感染しており、小腸に寄生する回虫が、せっかく摂取した貴重な栄養素を食い荒らし、栄養不足に陥った子供たちの健全な発達が阻害されている。これも「虫下し」を飲めばたちどころに解決する問題なのだが、中国の農村部では「回虫は体に良い（アレルギーを防ぐ等）という非科学的な迷信が信じられていて、虫下しの普及を阻害している。最後の壁が幼児近視の高さである。中国では、「12歳未満で眼鏡をかけることは、目を悪くし、視力を奪う」という非科学的な迷信が強く信じられていて、農村部では多くの子女が、強い近視であるにもかかわらず、メガネの着用を通じた視力矯正を受けられないでいる。そして科学的には何の根拠もない「視力回復に向けた目のマッサージ」が学校で広く行われ「この目のマッサージさえやっていれば視力はそのうち回復する」と強く信じられている。この結果、黒板の文字も、街の看板もきちんと見ることが出来ないまま12歳を迎える大量の子女がいる。視力の低下は知力の低下に直結する。REAPプログラムでは、中国農村部の子女への視力検査の実施と眼鏡の無償許与を実施している。自分にあった正しい眼鏡を装着したときに中国農村部の子女が示す「きちんとモノが見えた」ことに対する素直な喜びと笑顔は、我々の支援活動に対する最大の報酬のひとつだ。もうひとつ、多くの人が見落としがちだが、見落としてはならない重要な点がある。それは、中国の貧しい農村部では、そもそも親が子育てのやり方を知らないということだ。先進各国で新生児が生まれると、両親は何をするか。しきりに話かけ、いないいないバーをしては、子どもを笑わせようとする。幼児用のおもちゃを買い与え、遊ぶことを覚えさせようとする。同じことは中国の都市部の家庭でも当たり前のこととして行われている。これが中国の農村部では、基本的に行われていない。そもそも両親は都市に出稼ぎに行っていて農村部にはいない。子育てをするのは、祖父母や兄弟の役目となるのだが、彼らはおんぶひもで子供を背負って、一日中農作業や勉強をしている。こうしていれば、確かに安全ではあるのだが、子どもに話しかけたり、子どもと遊ぶということを彼らは基本的にしない。「なぜ子供に話しかけないのか」と尋ねると、「話かけても返事しないので、つまらないから」という答えが返ってくる。祖父母もそうやって育てられたし、それが当たり前だとみんなが思っている。しかし、これが重要な問題の原因となっている。乳幼児の知能は三歳までで決まってしまう。それまでに話かけ、読み聞かせを行わないと、言語能力の発達が遅れ、認知能力（Cognition）の発達が阻害される。農作業や工場労働のような単純作業に従事するならば、これでも済んでしまうのだが、絶えず変化する環境の中で、その都度変化に対応することが求められる高度な知的労働に従事することを求められる社会では、こうした子育て方法では、きちんとした人材育成は出来ないことになってしまう。【中国の教育制度と地方財政制度という壁】中国の教育制度は、大学進学を目指す進学校コースと、職業訓練校コースというツートラックシステムを取っている。これはドイツの制度に倣ったものだ。ドイツの職業訓練校では、カリキュラムの78％が一般教養で、進学校コースほどでは無いにせよ高度な知的訓練を施す内容になっている。中国ではそうなっていない。中国では高度な知的訓練は職業訓練校ではほとんど取り上げられず、自動車整備のような極めて実際的な職業訓練が行われる。これは見方を変えると、そうした職業が要らなくなった場合、全く他に応用が効かない、つぶしが効かない教育内容であることを示している。それに中国の学費は安くない。職業訓練校といえども、結構な学費を取る。すると何が起きるか。こんな学校で時間を潰しているより、現場に出て働いた方がずっとましだと高校を中退する生徒が大量に出てくるのである。中国の高卒以上の学歴がなかなか伸びない最大の原因がここにある。底辺校で学ぶことに喜びを感じられないだけでなく、経済的に見ても底辺校にいる理由が無いと多くの生徒が合理的に判断してしまうのだ。中国の教育は地方政府が面倒をみることになっている。地方政府にとっては教育にカネをかけるインセンティブが働かない。いくら教育にカネをかけ、その結果良い人材が育ったとしても、優秀な人材はみんな都会に出ていく。地方で働いて地方の財政に貢献する恩返しは、基本的に期待できない。教育は地方政府にとっては完全な持ち出しであり、しかもその成果が出てくるのは十年後、二十年後である。自分が地方政府にいるのは長くて数年である。教育制度をいくら良くしたとしても、自分の評価には絶対につながらない。それだったら、すぐに成果が出る橋とか道路を作る方が優先される。ほとんどの地方政府官僚は、こう考える。だから教師の待遇は改善されず、人材が集まらない。中央政府が旗を振って、教育に力を入れろと号令が出ても、校舎が立派になるだけで、中身の改善が伴わない。これが今の中国で実際に起きていることである。それに、仮に今の教育制度が劇的に改善されたとしても、その成果が出てくるのは20年後である。いま、既に成人し、働いている人たちの質的向上はどうやって実現するのだという重い課題がある。リカレント教育などというが、リカレント教育は世界的にどの国でもうまくいった事例はない。やはり高度な認知能力は幼児期に身に付けないと、後から補うことは非常に難しい。それで、取り残された単純作業しか出来ない大量の労働者に対する救済策として考案されたのが一帯一路構想だったのだが、前述の通り、一帯一路構想は諸外国で必ずしも歓迎されていないし、採算の合う巨大プロジェクトも、そう多いわけでもない。","报告","","","3

"Vivian K Lockwood","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Thought provoking analysis of modern China's hidden flaws.","2022年1月7日 在英国审核","已确认购买","For anyone who has come to believe that the economic rise of China to world pre-eminence is inevitable this book is well worth a read. The authors examine the social, cultural and political flaws within the system that could well impact as the country moves away from a low wage economy to middle income status. The process has already started and maybe the Chinese system and society is so unable to respond to the challenges that it will eventually fail to reach its promise. That would affect us all, argue the authors.The evidence is well argued and coherent. It is not, however, exhaustive. There is little mention of how utterly corrupt the system is from top to bottom nor of the many barriers to employment and promotion which exist for Chinese workers unless they have 'connections', especially within the ruling communist party.It's a good read and well worth examination.","报告","","","","","","",""
"Michael Rooke","2.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","A lengthy disposition, but not wide or deep","2020年11月8日 在英国审核","已确认购买","Three basic propositions are made in the course of this book. 1) millions of rural citizens are being left behind in China's economic development 2) the education of rural citizens is not a priority for China's leaders 3) the prescription of multi-vitamins would transform the health and intellect of the rural population.  Examples of these three propositions are made and repeated over and over in this over-long book.It is true that the pursuance of globalism has resulted in the off-shoring of 75 million jobs, by China, to places where it's cheaper and where environmental regulations are low - places like Ethiopa, Senegal and Kenya, who now have vast economies zones and factories.However, improving the education and health of the millions of urban poor in China so that they can aspire to be astronauts or computer whizz kids , and can join in the consumerism that is already destroying our planet, is simplistic in the extreme.I am sorry to say that this book informs to some degree (hence 2 stars) but offers no realistic insights into the future of China.","报告","","","1 个人发现此评论有用","","","",""
"Apicius","5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星","Essential reading","2021年3月28日 在英国审核","已确认购买","Lucid, convincing and backed up by thorough research this is is an important book. As the author says from the outset, he is writing as a person deeply committed to China's wellbeing. The urban-rural divide is carefully researched but characterised by good examples. The education picture is invaluable not just for China - indeed this book could be seen as an international blueprint. 186 pages of lucid and convincing narrative analysis, 45 pages of backup notes and indexing. Good standalone, but excellent if written with other detail on China. Highly recommended.","报告","","","4 个人发现此评论有用","","","",""
