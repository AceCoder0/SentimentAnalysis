Reality Versus the Narrative This is some heavy duty stuff. If this book is factual and accurate it paints a very damning portrait of U.S. involvement in Asia. Theodore Roosevelt allowed his administration to be penetrated by the Japanese and he did their bidding during the peace negotiations of the Russo-Japanese War. Teddy betrayed Korea in the process. Should his Nobel Peace prize be rescinded? It's an interesting question to consider. Another revelation, Franklin Delano Roosevelt's family wealth came from Opium smuggling in China. A handful of bungling nitwits in FDR's administration created an oil embargo against the Japanese that was a contributing spark behind the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor. I mean, wow. The levels of stupidity and incompetence here are staggering. Well worth the read.My only gripe is on page 330. Once again I find an author and his proof readers have mixed up the B-29 with the B-52. Come on gang, this Boeing bomber stuff is not that difficult to get right is it? Do better next time.
