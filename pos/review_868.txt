Excellent history of  US relations with China and related asian nations Br√†dleys book filled  in a lot of the holes in my unserstanding of the US relationship in China.  My father served in the 14th Air Force based in Kunming, said Chaing Kai Shek was a crook and so was his wife but the chinese people were wonderful.  Bradley book adds a lot to what my father related to me and also explores opportunities lost with Mao- I really look at China differently after reading this book.
