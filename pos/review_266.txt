Caught Red-Handed Holy smokes...I had no idea some of the most prominent elites in this country have been corrupted by Chinese investments, a bipartisan list of politicians, sports and entertainment celebrities, tech gurus, universities, and entrepreneurs that will make you want to throw up. It's sickening the depth of corruption they'll sink to for the sake of money, to cooperate with a foreign country that puts our country at risk in far more ways than I ever imagined, and lifts China higher on the world ladder. And it's sickening the lengths they'll go to to cover it up. Bought and paid for by the Chinese Communist Party. It's a gruesome read that affirms the argument for term limits for politicians and why we shouldn't idolize anyone who places China over the United States.This wasn't easy reading...both due to the content and the emotional response as I was reading.Mr. Schweizer meticulously researched the part our elites play in the China/USA games, and it's an eye-opener for sure. A part of me wishes I hadn't read it, the other congratulates me for doing so.If you have any doubt as to China's end goal; if you have any doubt whether politicians are held hostage by the CCP; if you have any doubt how some of these people get so stinking rich, look no further. It's all here in black and white.
