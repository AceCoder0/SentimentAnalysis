Awesome Book! Exposes the Criminals! Peter Schweizer has done it again. Pulled back the curtain with FACTS and EVIDENCE of the corruption, bribery, and money laundering that infests our Political Elites. If you are reading this, you already know that the ONLY MENTION you'll ever see of this book in the MSM, will be attempts to claim they've "debunked" the truths followed by more Gaslighting. If MSM (cough, Washington Post, cough cough) was doing their job, books like this would be unnecessary. But as it is, this book underscores the sad truth that MSM has truly become "fake news" and the "enemy of the people" in their Gaslighting and support of political narratives; their most recent, "inflation is good"... I mean seriously?
