excellent book I knew that politicians and universities were deeply connected to China, just because of the money involved. One of my former business partners was a Clinton crony with strong ties to the DNC. He and his DNC buddies were traveling to China, starting businesses and partnerships with China and generally raking in money. It seemed wrong to me so I cut off my relationship. At the same time George Mason University connected with the Confucious Institute and began getting donations. That was 2005-2006. Since then, things have gotten worse by orders of magnitude. When you read this book, you'll see the tip of the iceberg. Politicians all kinds, high profile athletes, elite universities and big businesses are grabbing tons of money and flying top cover for china even when its bad for the USA. Read this book. It just scratches the surface of how bad things are, but it shows that we're in trouble. The last chapter, on how we fight back is worth the price of the book. We need to start holding our politicians, universities and businesses accountable for what they are doing, before it's too late.
