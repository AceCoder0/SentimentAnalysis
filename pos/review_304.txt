Big Tech and the Washington Elites have sold us out! Peter Schweizer does a great job of researching his material.  There’s a reason that half our members of Congress are Millionaires and the other half are soon to be Millionaires.  No one else can parlay 150-170K annual salaries into enormous wealth other than Members of Congress, the President and VP, and Supreme Court Justices.  Our Colleges and Universities have sold us out too.  Hundreds of Millions of dollars are donated to our Institutions of Higher learning and 80 percent of those Sellouts don’t report any of the Foreign gifts to the IRS.  Appalling!!!!
