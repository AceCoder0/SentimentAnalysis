The con continues ‘The China Mirage’ by James Bradley lay out the history of the United States dealings with Asia and the unbeleivable influence of the China Lobby. It was an eye opening account from the early 1800s and how the US, UK, and other ‘civilized’ countries forced trade upon the Asia countries. This led to the inlfux of opium into China and how these conuntries fostered and took advantage to a black market trade. I couldn’t belive how the Soong’s were able to understand and play the American feelings of ‘saving’ these peoples by bringing them Christian religions. To develop an organization that was able to get so much money from the US, and fool most of the country. It made me angry at how the people who knew the truth were shut down and dis-credited.I get the same uneasy feelings of a secret lobby group when I think of the secret discussions between the Russians and the Trump campaign. When you look at the US’ history, we are not very good at helping a conuntry and their people. I enjoyed the book for the information provided. It is a fine razors edge on when to get involved in a countries problems or to stay out. It is a shame that so many people, American, Chinese, Japanese, etc had to suffer and die.
