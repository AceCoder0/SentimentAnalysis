A copy of "Red Handed" needs to be sent to EVERY menber of the Department of InJustice! Peter is "On Point" as always! The Facts in his writings should ALL be investigated by our DOIJ, but Corruption has infested yet Another Govermment Agency. If they had "Any" honest leadership, all of this would be invetigated and instead of Hiding the results like usual, when it is of Democrat Party relation, it should be COMPETENTLY tried in Court and COMPETENTLY Convicted! I suggest reading "Clinton Cash" while you're at it. The Corruption in the Democrat Party is Unbelievable...and the Executive branch of our Govenment is either to afraid or to Corrupt to properly and Honestly investigate them!
