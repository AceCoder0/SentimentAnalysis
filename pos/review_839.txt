Not part of curriculum American History. Unfortunately Americans  have been  discouraged from questioning the motives of their government when it comes to foreign affairs. We all become authorities after we find ourselves in a difficult quagmire, people seem to have trouble understanding nothing happens in a vacuum. The attack on pearl Harbor is a perfect example, usually as American History was taught chronologically we came to Pearl Harbor at the rush ending of a school year, it was made to seem as if the Japanese woke up 1 morning and decided to attack . The little we were told of Korea was it was the 1 clear war breaking the Brian Kellogg pact because U.N. observers were on the scene when the North invaded the South. What wasn't covered from the Pentagon papers was Roosevelt's promise to Ho Chi Minh of a independent Vietnam in exchange f ok r Vietnam' s support against the Japanese. This book and The Coldest Winter make excellent companion pieces, they also serve as a tutorial to conducting foreign policy in the middle east where I fear people are shouting solutions without any real knowledge of the history of the people and the area. Last thought this book also speaks of a world when the U.S. did not have the military industrial Complex of today, we have stepped into a predicament of our own making which I fear there is no turning back.
