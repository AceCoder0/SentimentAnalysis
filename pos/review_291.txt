What An Incredible Book This book will grab your attention right at the beginning and you won't be able to put it down.  Peter Schweizer does an incredible job of showing the corruption of various American political leaders in their dealings with China.  The book is well researched and the documentation is amazing.  President Biden and his family along with Senator Feinstein, Senator Mitch McConnell And Speaker Nancy Pelosi are only a few that are included.
