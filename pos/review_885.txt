Another beacon of light to explain the 20th century I always wondered growing up in the 50s what the real story of Chiang and Mao was.  How did Taiwan become so powerful for such a small island.  And why did Nixon so want to open up China to trade.  Now I know, along with the parallels in Vietnam.  Who are also now our friends.  Such a lack of knowledge.  And a tragedy.
