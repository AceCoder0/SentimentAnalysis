Need to read to understand what China is up to This book is sort of an academic work (though one steeped in policy) and that shines through at times in terms of how it is organized. Doshi is a better writer than most academics though. Moreover, it is easily one of the best books at helping lay readers and experts alike understand Chinese grand strategy in the post Cold War era. Doshi does what every great scholar should— he goes right to the source by using the CCP’s own words and documents, as well as its actions, to trace this grand strategy. It is quite compelling.
