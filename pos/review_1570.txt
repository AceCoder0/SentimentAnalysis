An engaging book about the Chinese Communist Party "The Party" is very interesting and engaging. Perhaps because the author is a journalist, the book includes many stories which make it much more enjoyable to read than a dry academic text about the Chinese Communist Party. The book's main problem is the atrocious editing: numerous typographical errors mar the text.
