A Not-So-Secret World There is no point in describing what The Party is about; the topic is obvious. The only thing really required is to comment on whether it is good or not, and, as it happens, it is quite good. McGregor did plenty of research and his interviews with officials help enliven the text. The book is not, unlike a few China books of late, toadying or sensationalistic. Mr. McGregor is a journalist and his investigative skills, analysis, and objectivity really shine. The Party would be good for China-book completists or newbies. China hands, however, might not find a whole lot they did not already know. In any event, the volume represents another piece in the puzzle. There are so many good China books out there, and this is yet another one. Recommended.Troy Parfitt is the author of Why China Will Never Rule the World
