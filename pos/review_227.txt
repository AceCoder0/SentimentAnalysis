A Great Read I've done research about China and taught development economics for nearly three decades. This is an outstanding book, one that I enjoyed reading and that my students loved. Unlike many of the "popular" books about China, often written by people with limited, anecdotal knowledge of the country, it's based on rigorous, peer-reviewed research conducted over decades. Importantly, this doesn't mean that the book is dry or boring; to the contrary, it pairs the research with examples and stories that make the subject come to life and the issues understandable to the non-specialist and to the student. Rozelle's analysis is thoughtful at all times, acknowledging the counterarguments and everything that we don't know and can't easily predict. Rozelle also draws from the experience of other countries to help us think through possible scenarios as China attempts to make the transition to high-income country. Recommended not just to understand China better, but also to learn more about economic development and poverty reduction in general, especially in places that have escaped extreme poverty but may risk getting stuck in the "middle-income trap."
