Worth the time Altho Bradley’s writing style is lacking at times, the history of America’s involvement in China and Japan is invaluable. Eye opening ! Gives historical perspective into US relations with the Koreas, Vietnam. I am now reading Imperial Voyage .... I think that is the title. Examines Teddy Roosevelt’s attempts to meddle in far east. Again, eye opening !!!!
