Red Handed Highlights the continual and irritating reality of how deep ‘backscratching’ travels through every facet of life.For those who view life choices detailed herein as narcissistic, self serving and in many cases, clear hypocrisy, can only hope, and ask the question; ‘how do you sleep at night?’.

Personally, I spent time tasting some of the ‘fruits’ and they can be great!  But one can only decide how their moral compass reads and decide how to engage and lead their life with clarity and happiness because, on your death bed, what did it all mean?
