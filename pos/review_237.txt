A valuable but expensive (Kindle) book about China What I like about this book:- excellent work on uncovering reasons that hold back rural China: intestinal works, anemia & poor eyesight- interesting information on the importance of early childhood education- frank, direct assessment about the governmentWhat the book is lacking:- the author could have provided more concrete statistics in forms of charts/tables (I don't recall seeing any meaningful ones from the Kindle version)- the why question: there is a lack of discussion about why the government appears oblivious to the problem until (seemingly) it was raised by the authorsWhat I found confusing about this book:- The authors portray overly rosy picture about Taiwan economy. To my knowledge, wages have been stagnating for a while and many factories already relocated to mainland and many university graduates struggle to find good paying jobs.- The authors tend to presume because of A, it will result in B.  We know that the world is far too complex to be reduced to such a simplified thinking.
