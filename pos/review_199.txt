Erudite and insightful as ever E R has never written a bad book and China is no exception. I like that it's not like a history lesson but three or four separate stories which interweave and introduce us to an alien culture from which we could and should have learned. And the British Empire does not cover itself in glory; then again China has its share of wrong headed mismanagement also. Engaging and revelatory!
