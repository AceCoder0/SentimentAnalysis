An epic and detailed adventure story At 764 pages, woo!, China is mine. It is the first book I’ve read by Edward Rutherfurd, known for writing epic tomes about significant places and times in history, across generations.Set during the Opium Wars, and with his panning of characters on all sides of the issue, I learned so much more about the perspectives of those involved. It was also a deep dive into culture in China, Great Britain, and the world at this significant time. There is a strong sense of adventure and even a touch of romance and drama to this story. I’ll never forget Mei-Lhing, Trader, and a eunuch named Lacquer Nail.Overall, Rutherfurd is adept at presenting well-researched history from all sides and in an approachable, highly readable way. I can’t imagine how much time it took to plan this saga and tie these story threads together.I received a gifted copy.
