"Bridging my knowledge gap" I am an individual who practices in a highly technical field that is, arguably, completely independent of geopolitics.  I, nonetheless, have had an ageless fascination with history since early childhood. I voraciously try to obtain resources on topics for which I am deficient.  China and the workings of its 21st-century rise are examples.I purchased and read this book to help contextualize many of the names (e.g. Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin, Hu Jintao, Xi Jinping) , places, and organizations (e.g. CICA, AIIB) that I have peripherally known about/of through news articles over the years.The book seems to be well-cited and presents facts and opinions in an organized manner.  While one may not fully agree with some themes throughout the book, it does present information well.In summary,  the book is an excellent primer to get one up to speed and current with geopolitical knowledge.  The information is current to the first part of the world pandemic.
