Another excellent historical novel by Edward Rutherford. Beginning in the 1800's he gives an accounting of the great land of China during the time of the British empire and the European colonies. He brings to life the opien wars.  the missionary life and the Boxer Revolution. The stories and characters are wonderfully written and detailed.I enjoyed this novel as I have enjoyed all of his past novels.
