We are playing a dangerous game with China Author highlights the dangerous game our elites are playing with China. From Bidens to Bushes and McConnells to Pelosis, they are taking money to influence American politics in favor of China and helping China in their ultimate goal: to be the top player in the world. They want to dominate economically, technically, and militarily. Keep in mind, they are also a totalitarian state. They repress the Uighars and Tibetans (Dalai Lama exiled), they have no judicial due process, they have surveillance cameras everywhere, they don't have free speech, there are no elections. We are not perfect but arguably our system has done more to raise economic and freedom levels than any other in the world. I'm not sure that would happen with China as the world's superpower. Get in the fight and resist.
