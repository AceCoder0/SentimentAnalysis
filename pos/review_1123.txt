Balanced and nuanced analysis of a complex situation There is no shortage of books by "China experts", but their tones generally fall into one of two categories: the China-juggernaut-get-used-to-it type and the China-will-collapse-within-X-months type. This book succumbs to neither extreme, but presents a detailed and nuanced analysis of both the dangers which China presents and the challenges it faces. The fresh take which Brands and Beckley offer is the conclusion that the very structural weaknesses which menace China should not be a source of complacency or gloating in the West, but cause for grave concern, since it is ascendant powers that perceive windows of opportunity closing who are most dangerous. They don’t offer specifics about what China will do next (though they make some educated guesses), but instead try to help the reader understand the complex web of pressures acting on China, and how they are likely to respond. I found this a good companion to Steven Mosher’s /Hegemon/ to help me grasp the distinctive and non-Western mindset of the Chinese.Brands and Beckley propose solutions that the West can follow to blunt China’s impact. Whether the West has the unified will and moral fiber to implement them is another question, but that wasn’t the focus of this book.
