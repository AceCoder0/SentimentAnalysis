Enjoyed reading but left disappointed Enjoyed reading this book though not as much as his previous novels which take the reader much further back in the history of the characters. Unlike the other books, it also seems to glamorise the British and Western roles at the cost of truly reflecting the strength of history and culture of China.  However, what was most disappointing as a reader was the absence of a proper conclusion to some of the central characters such as Mei Ling, her daughter and her family.
