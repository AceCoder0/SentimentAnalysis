I can't recommend this book too highly - the solution to the China puzzle Many people have been wondering how China, such a populous and huge country, is run in such an apparently tidy way. Even China experts are often puzzled by the question.Richard McGregor is no ordinary China expert.  His book "The Party: the Secret World of China's Communist Rulers" has solved the puzzle.The book is based on a wealth of information, including much that is not accessible to most people.  Thanks to his considerable knowledge and experiences in China and the world in general, his analysis of the information is astute and convincing. His intense curiosity and intrepid exploration has redefined investigative journalism. The readers benefit by all this.As the subject matter is so big, no one should be expected to cover all the fields.  Regrettably, the book doesn't deal adequately with how the Party controls the news. I hope he will produce another book to address this topic.If you're going to read only one book in order to understand China, this  is it.
