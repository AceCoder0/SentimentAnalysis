So far the best expose of our government corruption This expos√©  of American government corruption should be read by every American .  I have spent some time is researching the almost 100 pages of notes.  Thank you Mr. Schweizer and your staff for such an excellent accounting about the convoluted corruption and evil that pervades our government- feeding the public with lies, misinformation.  These are absolutely feckless and self serving individuals who worry more eating from the money sty than serving the people.Our Freedom ringing bell is unfortunately been silenced with this deceitful and unchristian government.  (Not all, we still have many who have moral fiber that may bring back some decency and pride)
