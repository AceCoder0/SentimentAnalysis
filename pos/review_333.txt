DETAILED PRESENTATION HOW AMERICANS ARE STRENGTHENING THE CHINESE COMMUNISTS. What I like about this book is the author's objective analysis.  He "outs" both sides of the political spectrum... If one wants to understand how the Chinese Communist Party has grown, one has only to look at how our American "oligarchs" and politicians have enabled it for the money and power they accumulate by supporting the CCP to the peril of the world.
