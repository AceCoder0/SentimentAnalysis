A must read for any outsider interested in the CP I approached this book as a ‘foreigner’ curious to learn about the CCP. Coming from a multi-party noisy democracy like India, it was always a puzzle as to how a single party system would work, leave alone survive for 70 years. And of course, there were bits and pieces of stories and anecdotes heard over the years about life in China under the party.The author does an extremely detailed job on the topic, presenting the various parts of the CCP - in relation to topics such as businesses, army, history etc. The book is rich with anecdotes, real events that shot to national limelight etc to make us get a ring side feel of what transpired in the 15-20 years upto 2010.Would love to read a sequel that includes the Xi Jinping era.
