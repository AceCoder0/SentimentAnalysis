Understanding leads to Modern China Typical great read by this author.  Provides an important understanding of not only the events but also Chinese culture leading up to modern China.  The "Century" (actually 140 years) of "Humiliation" leading up to 1980 when the post Mao era began China`s recovery and miraculous development to international trade leadership is well documented here.  Very good book!
