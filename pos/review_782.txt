An invaluable contribution to a timely - and critical - subject “Avoidable War” is exactly what the title suggests; it is former Australian Prime Minister and Sinologist Kevin Rudd’s attempt to find a way for the United States and China to avoid a potentially catastrophic war, through the concept of “managed strategic competition.”The greatest strength of this book is Rudd’s detailed and thoughtful examination of “Xi Jingping Thought” through his “concentric circles” framework.  Unfortunately, Rudd does not devote nearly as much attention to the United States, whose own domestic issues may play as prominently a role as whatever Xi can - or cannot - do in the case of China.Still, this is a careful, well thought, and valuable contribution to the rapidly growing literature on U.S. China relations, one that should be on every American policymaker’s reading list.4.5/5
