A Mirage for Over 150 Years? James Bradley, the son of a soldier in the Pacific War, wanted to trace the cause of this devastating war, which killed more than 41,000 soldiers and injured more than 145,000. In his description, the war originated from a China Mirage -Americans imagined that they could help godless China transform into a Christian democracy. Consequently, their supply of resources to China and reduced the oil supply to Japan triggered the attack on Pearl Harbor, which was the prelude to the Pacific War.Whether knowing rather than imaging China would develop a different course for the Pacific War is debatable. Still, Bradley's research on the relationship between China and America during the first half of 20's century revealed wealthy official and anecdote materials for anyone who is interested in China's contemporary history and why China has become present China, to read and think.History is impossible to assume. It took more than 60 years to repeal the Chinese Exclusion Act, and another 60 years have passed since then. Many well-educated "Chinese Nobel farmers" have become Citizens of the United States. However, do we know more about real China now, or is China still a mirage in most Americans' minds?
