China is magnificent I didn't expect that a novel covering 100 years of Chinese history would succeed in showing the richness of Chinese culture and explain it and what the West did because the country couldn't grow. I couldn't put the book down. It was brilliant, sad, thoughtful and beautiful like a lawyer box of many layers.
