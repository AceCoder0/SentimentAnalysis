A great expose of China corruption Great stuff. A terrific expose of the greed and hypocrisy of China's leaders, released well before New York Times and Bloomberg exposed the fiasco that was called Wen Jiabao. If you are a part apparatchik in China, anything goes. Small wonder dissatisfaction grows every year in the PRC.
