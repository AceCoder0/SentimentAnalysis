Another Great Rutherford Read! Having lived in Hong Kong, and visited Macau on several occasions, (not to mention tours of both The Forbidden City and mountainous Guilin), I found this book to be of great personal interest. His accounts of these areas are quite detailed, and interestingly, to this day still relevant. I especially enjoyed the very accurate description of the Old Protestant Cemetery in Macau, (which I have visited numerous times), and can confirm it as described...still, more than a century later than the time of this story.I've read a number of Rutherford's book, (London, New York, The Forest, etc), and highly recommend any of these and of course, China. You'll not only be swept away in the well researched history, you're sure to enjoy the many excellent character portrayals as well!
