Lifting the Mirage for the Future Relations I have been to China, including visiting the school where the three Soong sisters attended. When I was in China, I thought that there was a disconnect between my previous readings and understandings of China and reality. James Bradley's book clarified the disconnect, as we all bought into the "mirage." Since the beginning of our relationship with China, the US has been misinformed by those in power and those who put greed first. He clearly explains through his research and reporting why the US got it so wrong for so long, the consequences of misinformation, and perhaps, looking into the future, the continuation of misinformation through the "mirage." This book should be part of the China studies curriculum and used for continuing research on the US-China relationship in the future.
