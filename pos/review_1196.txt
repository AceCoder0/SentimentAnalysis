History as future past History... Clio, daughter of Zeus and Mnemosyne, memory. But we do not sit near the dance that discloses the day's passing to the mind of the father, nor do we look with open eyes even upon the days that are our own. So when reading of an appearance concerning China, one whose wisps wound through everything from the foreign policy of the United States to the classroom of the little boy I once was, there arose in me a sense of relief, a kind of glad fulfillment. The story of the past, repeated like a drum is beaten when growing up, felt incomplete, ever unfinished, and the ground of many unanswered questions. So it is refreshing to be introduced to the humanity of heroes and our penchant for hiding the truth under the shadow of our desires. I would only warn that if reading of what we have been and done does not stimulate closer attention to what we are and do today, James Bradley's book is a tragic tale of thirst, being lost, and dying in the desert.
