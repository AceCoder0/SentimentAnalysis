I knew it was bad... I knew we were selling out to the Communist Chinese, but I didn't realize it was this deep. I love how Shweizer goes into detail and tells about all the connections between the American and Chinese governments and businesses. I had to put the book down a few times because I was so shocked. Shocking is the best way to describe this book in general.
