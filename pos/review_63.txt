A wonderful read Rutherfurd is one of the few masters of historical fiction. I read several of his books decades ago, and he hasn't lost his touch. Everything works in this book--Rutherfurd expertly weaves a tapestry of characters, history, culture and dramatic events. I was worried about following the characters with Chinese names, but it wasn't an issue. This was a very satisfying read.
