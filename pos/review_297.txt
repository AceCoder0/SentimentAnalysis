Frightening This book truly helps reveal how far the “Deep State” stretches. This is a book that should concern EVERY person, but specifically, Americans. No matter what party you belong to, this calls into question politicians from BOTH sides of the aisle, and shows that We the People are being screwed over by BOTHA parties…… and they stand to gain EVERYTHING if we don’t come together as citizens and STOP the politicians and government that pit us against ourselves, because they know, if we got together as people, we’d probably go against them.
