Excellent This book offers an experienced author's view, showing clarity of structure, long term motivations, flexibility and abuses of the Chinese Communist Party.  One begins to understand much better the many veils behind which the CPC works at the national, provincial and city levels with specific of people and enterprises.  There is much to admire of China's history and its recent rise -- but much more to understanding the many penalties that Chinese society pays.  Richard McGregor has written a truly excellent book.
