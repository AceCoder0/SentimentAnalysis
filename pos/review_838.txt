When History is Hidden, We All Lose Bradley has written a fascinating history of America’s perceptions of China.  To do that, he has to explain Chinese history and compare that history to America’s perception of China. Bradley points out the insanity of our American recognition of Taiwan as “China,” when the real China has 1.3 billion people and 9.6 million square kilometers of land, while Taiwan has only 23 million people and 36 thousand square miles of territory. Bradley explains how we arrived at this skewed perception of the number 2 superpower, and gives us fascinating details on the way.  Sure I have read of the China trade and China Clipper ships, but I ignorantly thought people made fortunes in porcelain and silks.  Sure I knew there were opium wars and an Open Door Policy, but I never put together a timeline or really understood the issues.  Bradly documents how England and the US fought to sell opium to China and how the profits of those drug sales were the foundation of many American fortunes and even more misconceptions.  Bradley explains how Chinese politicians managed American perceptions and how smart American politicians playing to a domestic audience missed multiple opportunities to create real alliances and act in both countries self-interest. If only we had realized these facts 50 years ago.  The China Mirage is a fascinating book because it explains what I never understood-the reasons why the US considered a little island to be the real China for 30 years while the continental China was ignored as a type of Russian vassal state.  Unlike many histories, The China Mirage never bores and always enlightens.  It is a fascinating and entertaining read.  I highly recommend it.
