An eye-opener even for old China hands Although I have spent my last 11 years doing consulting business in China, this book revealed a whole new context of isolated facts and experiences I always wanted to understand better. It obviously has an impressive amount of research behind it, and yet makes an entertaining read that you cannot put down. I can't wait to get through some backlog and read it again!
