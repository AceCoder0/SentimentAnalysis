VERY Informative Book but contains an ERROR The China Mirage by James Bradley.On Page 330, the Author James Bradley, states that General Curtis Lemay on March 11, 1945 bombed Tokyo with B-52's with Napalm. That is incorrect, the B-52 was not in use in 1945. That particular aircraft was not on drawing boards at that time. The B-29 was in use.
