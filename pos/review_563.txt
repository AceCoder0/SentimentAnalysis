Excellent book, so many things to know. Peter Schweitzer has written several books on government corruption and although I come away from each one of them thinking how is it possible that our government, our elected officials can abuse the power that we have given them and be such poor stewards of our trust.  I must say that I am at least reassured that someone is watching and noting and publicizing the abuse.  We as a United American People must very soon  torch the corruption and the hypocrisy and the betrayal that these politicians have brought on us.  These unelected partisan bureaucrats must be removed.
