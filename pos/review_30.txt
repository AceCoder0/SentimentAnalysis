Another enjoyable historical novel by the author! As an avid fan of the authorâ€™s previous works, I was not disappointed with long-awaited China. It was chock full of engaging storylines and well-defined characters. Also expected, the vivid descriptions of the towns and cities brought the book to life. Like all good books, it held my interest until the end. I learned some interesting facts about China and its complex culture. Such information is the hallmark of Rutherfurd novels. I recommend the book. Despite the praise, I thought the pace of the writing was a bit slow and the occasional change from third-person to first-person was unexpected, however, it only served to distract rather than annoy.
