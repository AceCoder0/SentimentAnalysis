Thought provoking analysis of modern China's hidden flaws. For anyone who has come to believe that the economic rise of China to world pre-eminence is inevitable this book is well worth a read. The authors examine the social, cultural and political flaws within the system that could well impact as the country moves away from a low wage economy to middle income status. The process has already started and maybe the Chinese system and society is so unable to respond to the challenges that it will eventually fail to reach its promise. That would affect us all, argue the authors.The evidence is well argued and coherent. It is not, however, exhaustive. There is little mention of how utterly corrupt the system is from top to bottom nor of the many barriers to employment and promotion which exist for Chinese workers unless they have 'connections', especially within the ruling communist party.It's a good read and well worth examination.
