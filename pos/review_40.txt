Might be my favorite Rutherford story line This is my third book of his .  Loved Serum and Russka  I enjoyed since I was familiar with Russian history. I knew  nothing of China's history and appreciated that this is set in a narrower time frame than the other two, which include ancient man.  I also found that the characters were easier to track since it only hit a couple of generations rather than hundreds of generations.  I will continue binge reading this author since his style seems like it changes enough to keep me interested.  I will also read more on Cixi and Back house. For me it is the salient test of an author capturing me in the story
