The best book on the subject ever written Mr. McGregor has written a definitive volume that offers the reader a perspective on the The Party that brings China into the focus that produces understanding. Though not devoid of judgement, the author's journalistic credentials have produced a disciplined writing that does not pander to any particular view. Yet it is more than "just the facts mam". The way the Party sits at the heart of everything Chinese becomes not only abundantly clear, but reveals facts and processes I have not seen anywhere else. There are two McGregors who write books on China following their journalistic days. Its not a question of which one is better. They are hands down the best in the business.
