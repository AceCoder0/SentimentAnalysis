What is the true power of China? China's true power is that it is a nation with over 1.3 billion people, which can probably provide the largest number of most industrious and most intelligent workers in the world.  The biggest misconception for the west is that we believe too much in the "BOSSES", childishly assuming that it was some capable BOSSES who created the China's economic miracle, while almost totally ignoring the importance of understanding Chinese people, and their culture, intellect, and love. During the 40-year US-China honeymoon, we didn't see anyone achieving what Pearl S. Buck did almost a century ago, even with the help of Internet. The west simply cannot treat China as a business only. We need to read and write about Chinese people.http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BQRHHHSMhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0BQRHHHSMhttp://www.amazon.de/dp/B0BQRHHHSMhttp://www.amazon.fr/dp/B0BQRHHHSMhttp://www.amazon.es/dp/B0BQRHHHSMhttp://www.amazon.it/dp/B0BQRHHHSMhttp://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0BQRHHHSMhttp://www.amazon.com.br/dp/B0BQRHHHSMhttp://www.amazon.ca/dp/B0BQRHHHSMhttp://www.amazon.in/dp/B0BQRHHHSMhttp://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B0BQRHHHSMhttp://www.amazon.com.mx/dp/B0BQRHHHSMhttp://www.amazon.nl/dp/B0BQRHHHSM
