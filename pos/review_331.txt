Too late? I had trouble following the trail of companies that many of the elite have in their dealings with China, but no trouble in understanding the result.  How sad that our high tech people have so little respect for the country that has allowed them to develop their products.  I guess money means more than human life.  I wonder if any of us would give up anything for someone else.
