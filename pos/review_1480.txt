IN CHINA, THE PARTY IS (DEFINITELY NOT) OVER "China has long known something that many in developed countries are only beginning to grasp, that the Chinese Communist Party and its leaders never wanted to be the west when they grow up."These words are on the last page of the book. They could just as easily have been at the beginning. Consider them as book ends for an Alice's Wonderlandisque journey, deep into a land where the societal norms and institutions look familiar, it's just that they function upside down. Take corruption for instance: "Corruption in China seems to operate like a transaction tax that distributes ill-gotten gains among the ruling class."Richard McGregor gives the reader, through many years of living in China and many in-depth interviews with those in industry and politics, a very informative and up to date look into the people who run this massive country.This reviewer originally had the image of a cast of marionettes on strings, controlled by a few master puppeteers. Makes one wonder if there may be an old Chinese proverb,  something about a string can be pulled from either end. A good read, and definitely one that will take away any fantasy that China ever "wanted to be the west when they grow up."
