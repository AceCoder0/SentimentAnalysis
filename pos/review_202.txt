Another breathtakingly epic tale ! If you have enjoyed all of Edward Rutherfurds other books, this will not disappoint you. I found it transported me completely. My imagination was given the type of treat that made this impossible to put down.  Poetic licence has been utilised in a way that seamlessly entwines fact and fiction.  A fantastic read that no doubt, will stay with you. Highly recommended.
