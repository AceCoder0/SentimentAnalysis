Fascinating(and very relevant) Book With all the fearmongering about Beijing going on today, this seemed like a good book to start understanding U.S-China relations better, and I was not disappointed. It's sad to think how much of the violence of the 20th century was avoidable. All the same, this book is a must read for those who hope to learn from history's mistakes
