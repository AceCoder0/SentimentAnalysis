Another outstanding book to Mr. Rutherfordâ€™s Credit An outstanding work of historical fiction by a true master of the genre. A very enjoyable read through 19th century Chinese history for those that would like a fictional glimpse into that period, which I would highly recommend for fans of historical fiction of the highest caliber as well.
