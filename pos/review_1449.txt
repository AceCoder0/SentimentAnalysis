including the unnecessary horror of the pacific war in WW2 This is a fascinating book, it really challenges and questions decisions made by the US at the start of the last century which likely had significant adverse impact on the world as a result, including the unnecessary horror of the pacific war in WW2, the Vietnam war, and the ostracization of China for so many years by the US. The world could be very different now if some key decisions had not been made by senior US politicians and diplomats lacking in knowledge and experience of the Japanese and Chinese cultures, including scandalous secret decisions made by both Roosevelts. It's not a heavy read and almost like a historical detective or expose story, not a turgid read! I've read all of James Bradley's books and while Flags of our fathers was an epic book, this is at least it's equal. Thought provoking.
