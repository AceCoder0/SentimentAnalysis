A good read but not his best I have read all of his books over many years.  I enjoy the way he introduces characters over many generations, often spanning centuries or longer through the introduction of different families and their descendants over the lengthy time period covered in the novel who are affected by historical events.  His historical research has always been very accurate and he is careful to point out where he is speaking from a historical source and where he has created fiction.This story was a good read but unfortunately he covered a relatively short period of Chinese history and really had many of the characters play pivotal roles throughout the entire time period, which made them a bit less believable as fictional characters.  (It was almost like some of them could have played Zelig in the Woody Allen movie).  I think this variance from the usual style over centuries, or even millennia, took away a bit from the writing appeal.  It also meant that some of the value I like to derive from historical novels of this sort, getting a very long term picture of the development of something I know little about, was lost.All that being said, it is certainly better than most of the garbage put out today.
