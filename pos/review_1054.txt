A must read. History is written by the victors, this gives you the real story. One more nail in the coffin of the fable of America as a benevolent force in the world. It is not true today, and was never true.  Recommend a good companion, “how to hide an empire” , Daniel immerwahr.  It was  a pattern, that unfortunately cannot end without an educated America.
