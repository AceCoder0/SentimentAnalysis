We are so screwed…. This book was sickening named so many names from both parties. I never knew how easy it was to buy off rich capitalists with money and flattery.  China sets the rules and our dopey politicians and elitists just follow them.  I don’t know how we come back from that— the last chapter contains a few “solutions”, so that’s a start. The last chapter also contains (very few) names of billionaires and politicians of both parties who have NOT been bought off by the CCP.  Surprisingly, Chuck Schumer is one of the good guys and actually cooperated with Trump on the China sanctions.In the meantime, Bill Gates, Zuckerberg, and Jack Dorsey all admire President Xi and CCP totalitarianism, and are helping China with tech in their Uigher oppression.  Billionaires with God complexes—who made their fortunes in freedom—wish to pull up the drawbridge so no one else can enjoy freedom. That is an astonishing revelation in this book.I’m a little miffed that the book didn’t scrutinize CA Governor Newsom. Newsom took campaign contributions from BYD, a Chinese company, in exchange for giving them government contracts.  Katy Grimes reported on this in The California Globe, and Kevin Kiley wrote about it extensively for his book Recall Newsom.  I hope Schweizer will eventually write a sequel to Red Handed (if we still exist as a country in the future), and include all the state governors who have been corrupted by the CCP. I feel that the book was a little incomplete due to its omission of governors.
