A Must Read - Whether Republican or Democrat Our Congress is Parliament of Whores.  As bad as Hunter Biden is, some Bush family members are just as bad or even worse.  It does not matter which side of the isle you are coming from, they all are taking cash from China.  It is appalling how many people retire from serving their country, to only turn around and betray their country for a big payday.  If only half this book were true, it would still be totally disgusting what some of these politicians, diplomats, and government workers have done and are doing.  I personally believe that the author has done a thorough job researching the book and that it is very accurate.  The book makes you pray that real journalism comes back to the television and newspapers to expose this cesspool.  Where are you 60 Minutes?  Where have you gone?  I am sure, that these activities by our government representatives, are not just going on with China, but with many other countries.  This is a must read for all Americans.  We need term limits, so that our Congress represents the people and not themselves!
