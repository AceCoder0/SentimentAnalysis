This book will inform the American public.  Well worth reading! This book provides an excellent overview of the elite capture that is taking place at the highest levels of our federal government and in business, finance, and higher education.  As citizens, we can be informed about what is taking place by reading books like this and seeing how China is trying to buy our elite so that they can impose policies and spread propaganda that is favorable to the Communist Party of China.  The more people know about what is happening, the more we are able to stop and reverse the present course of action.  We should be suspicious of politicians who are interested in more trade and investments in a communist country like China.  We need more people who are against communism in the elite parts of our government and in private businesses and in higher education.  This is one of the best books I have read about the influence of the Chinese Communist Party in American institutions.
