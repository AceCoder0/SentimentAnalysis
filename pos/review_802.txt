A succinct and easily accessible presentation of issues facing the USA and China This was a very timely and well written outline of the political, economic and cultural forces driving Xi Jinping, the Chinese Communist Party and the younger generation of Chinese nationalists in its confrontation with the USA after its recent economic and political decline.  It also points out areas of weakness that China has in its pursuit of global economic, political and military supremacy.  The author proposes a course of action for the USA and China "Managed Strategic Competition" that is hopeful, but seems excessively optimistic given current political and cultural wars ongoing in the USA and fervent nationalism that is manifesting itself in China.Nevertheless, this is one of the best non-fiction books that I have read in more than two years.
