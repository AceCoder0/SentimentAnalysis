China's Pay to Play Tactics at Work. From the Biden family to the Bush family, this book pulls no punches in exposing corruption and influence peddling that is rampant in out society. Ever wonder why popular athletes like LeBron James never speak ill of China? It is all about money and lucrative deals that the Communist Chinese Party makes with individuals and companies in exchange for influence and access. China has bought it's way into our universities, tech companies and almost every facet of our society. The Biden family is bought and paid for and has been for many years. Al this is documented thoroughly.Even the main stream press has largely bought into the lie that China is our friend. While we arm the Ukraine to ward off an invasion from Russia, China licks it's chops at the prospect of invading Taiwan. We buy their cheap products and support their military and spy machine and pretend that we are without blame but we are only strengthening China in their quest of world domination.Peter Schweizer backs everything up with documentation. The book is easy to read and I might even say that it is a must-read.
