A democracy that lost its way more than a century ago The China Mirage, backed by overwhelming factual evidence that was suppressed or ignored for decades, clearly reveals that America is not the peace loving democracy that most Americans think it is. The reality is that the U.S. is a global empire that took its first step toward World War II in the Pacific on July 8, 1853, when Commodore Matthew Perry commanded a U.S. Navy squadron that sailed into Tokyo harbor aboard the frigate Susquehanna. Perry—under orders from President Millard Fillmore—demanded a treaty permitting trade and the opening of Japanese ports to U.S. merchant ships. The reluctant Japanese leaders, who wanted to be left alone, were not given a choice if they wanted to avoid the same invasion of China mainly by the British and French during the Opium Wars that China lost.After being forced to open its doors to Western trade so American corporations could profit, Japan industrialized and built a modern military. The second step toward war in the Pacific took place about fifty years later when President Theodore (Teddy) Roosevelt started to meddle in Asia’s affairs.The book reveals that Teddy urged Japan to invade Korea in 1910 leading eventually to Japan’s invasion of China, because Teddy was obsessed with the Japanese and felt strongly that Japan’s role should be to protect Asia from being colonized by the European colonial powers even if it meant Japan’s military would dominate all of Asia.The third step toward war in the Pacific would be the bumbling, ignorant, secretive, back-stabbing, dysfunctional and manipulative administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt—with help from the powerful and wealthy lying Christian China Lobby that based its thinking on a faulty premise that the Chinese loved democracy and wanted to become a Christian country just like the United States.The powerful China Lobby’s ignorant agenda would cause the deaths of more than 25 million civilians (most of them Chinese) and 6 million troops (most of them Chinese) in addition to the bombed out devastation of Southeast Asia, China, Korea and Japan.The same ignorant and arrogant thinking caused the Vietnam War where U.S. troops fought for almost 20 years, and the United States dropped more bombs on Southeast Asia than it did in all of World War II.Readers will discover that Henry Luce, the publisher of Time and Life Magazines, who was called the most influential private citizen in America at the time, was a perfect example of how anyone who has too much power and wealth can create their own reality based on lies that often evaporate later leaving future generations to deal with the damage caused by these fools.I bought the unabridged audio book at Costco
