THIS IS A VERY DETAILED HISTORY OF ASIA James Bradley is a very detailed author.  I've read all of his books.  I've had The China Mirage for over a month and first thing in the morning I dedicate at least one hour to reading this piece of work.  You have to have a good memory for names to read this book.  Bradley has maps of Asia and photographs of all the people he mentions in the book.  I read at least one Non Fiction book and one Fictitious book always at the same time.  I must have read at least 15 fiction books and I'm only halfway through The China Mirage.  This has been my personal decision though.  This is not meant to be read fast.
