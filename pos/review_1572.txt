Answered My Questions "The party" is a well written, thoroughly researched, most interesting insider's look at how China can be both Communist and have such a booming industrial sector at the same time. The country is ruled by the party bosses from Beijing, who are not elected by the people, but from within their own ranks. Their dictates which can change at any time are the law. The officials at the county levels control what goes on in their provinces. This self policing, plus low wages inevitably leads to corruption. Also the Chinese people in each province want to outdo the other provinces as far as production and GDP are concerned, which leads to environmental pollution and quality control issues. Remember the Chinese pet food that killed so many American animals? Businesses walk a fine line. They can not do or say anything that would shed a negative light on the Communist party. A most fascinating look at what makes China tick that is well worth reading.
