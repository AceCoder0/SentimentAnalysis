19th Century China Excellent presentation of Opium trade, Commissioner Lin, and the first Opium War. Good insights into Chinese culture and British Colonialism. The Boxer presentation is less thorough, however. Some of the speculations concerning Dowager Empress Cici, are interesting but difficult to substantiate.
