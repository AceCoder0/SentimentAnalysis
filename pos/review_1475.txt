Would recommend to anyone curious about CCP I thought this was a great book. Of course, it's a few years old now so it mentions nothing of Xi Jinping in power at the helm. It only mentions Xi as a potential and likely successor. However, McGregor opens up your mind to a lot of the workings and structure of the CCP. He does a wonderful job at taking you methodically through the different bodies of the CCP and into a brief highlight of the history of some of its more prominent members. I would recommend this to anyone that has any curiosity about the Chinese Communist Party and would like to get a decent understanding of its workings. A caveat, however, is that McGregor could only unearth so much about the Party simply because knowledge about the Party is difficult to come by. Don't go in expecting to get a good understanding of its inner workings like you would somewhere like a similar book about the United States government. However, after reading the book you will be much more enlightened than coming into it.
