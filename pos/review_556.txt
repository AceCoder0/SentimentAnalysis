Heed The Warning This is by far the most disturbing book I have read on the threat China poses to America's democracy. What is so unsettling is how many of the elite so willingly participate in the demise of this great nation. The author exposes the corruption and greed by the elites, from Washington to Wall Street, Silicon Valley and by many American Universities.  The author does not make any generalized statements...these are well founded, documented, and thoroughly researched accounts of the corruption that exists. We must remain vigilant to the harsh realities and protest against an oppressive regime from taking over our beloved country. If we do nothing, we may very well fall to China's inhumane system of torture, incarceration without trial, massive censorship, and other very barbaric and disgusting tactics. China adopted their regime from Russia and they are equally as corrupt. The real threat is before us and we must focus on...because if we dont, we are doomed. Its that simple. I was a bit disappointed that the last chapter, Fighting Back, was only a few pages and seemed to be mostly directed toward executives and those in Congress who can enforce policies and move the nation toward a brighter future. I would like to have more information about what average citizens can do to make a difference, other than sharing information. It is time to change the direction we are headed for because I know we are going down a very dangerous path. Please read this book and do share it with everyone...maybe start a petition calling for change. Obviously, we must do more.
