That we are under the control of corrupt politicians who protect one another Peter Schweizer is a true National treasure. He tells it like it is and exposes these criminal politicians.  I am only half-way through this book and it is so much worse than you can even dream of.  I believe many now in office are there only to become wealthy. Pelosi now worth 350 MILLION dollars from insider trading. She passes the information to her husband the Pelosi's own a brokerage and he buys the stocks his wife has passed to him. We ordinary citizens would be serving time in prison if we did what many in Congress and the Senate do to enrich themselves. Sort of like shooting fish in a barrel--they can't lose.
