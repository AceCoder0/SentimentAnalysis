Fascinating, couldn’t put it down Absolutely loved this book, could not recommend it more if this topic remotely interests you. Fastest I’ve read a book in years because it’s just that good. I really like Mr. Bradley’s way of writing, sometimes it is hard for me to keep track of names in historical books, but I was able to follow this without any issue. Will certainly be looking in to his other works. 5 stars because I couldn’t do 6.
