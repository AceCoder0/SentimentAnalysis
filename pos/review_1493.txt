"Wow" and "Thank you, Richard" In one word- Amazed.  This is book is so wonderful,  I learned so much and I am stunned at how much he was able to learn as a foreigner in China.  The government is so tight lipped about their interworkings in the presence of foreigners.  I am so thankful for this book.  I have recommended it to my mother-in-law, friends and co-workers. Very happy with this purchase.  I thought it was a little pricey for an e-book but it is worth every dollar.
