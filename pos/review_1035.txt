Thank Goodness for this Book! If like me, you hated the study of history (especially asian history) while in school, you really need to read this book.  What confounded me in school was it seemed like none of the facts presented made any logical sense.  But when you first start reading this book, it seems like a history lesson that is sounding crazy, but it isn't long before all the disjointed historical facts start clicking together with crystal clear reality.  Suddenly - all the pieces of the puzzle fit and make perfect sense.Suddenly, the Roosevelt's aren't such hero's as our history writers would like for us to believe and accept without question.  Upon close and critical inspection, it's is now my opinion they are both a couple of ham-fisted, arrogant, sneaky buggars, who seemed to take pleasure in putting it over on the people whom the professed to serve.  By the way; you need to read, "The Imperial Cruise" prior to this book in order to get the whole perspective.Another eye opening book on FDR is Burt Folsom Jr's, "New Deal or Raw Deal".  In Chapter 1 is titled, "The Making of the Myth:  FDR and the New Deal".  It takes an honest look at our traditional historians and how hidden agendas and personal biases lead to a distorted presentation of the characters.After reading Bradley's and Folsom's books I got to thinking:  Gee, maybe if I was a good lier and manipulator, maybe I could be a US President some day too.  Where oh where has the idea of limited government gone?  Who out there would disagree that these leaders of our country need a shorter leash?A nice high note in the book was when Mayling came to President Harry Truman in '48 begging for another handout as the walls were crashing down around Chiang Kai-Shek.  "I discovered after some time, that Chiang Kai-Shek and the Madame and their families, the Soong family and the Kungs, were all thieves, every last one of them...".  Refreshing (for a change)!
