China's influence in America.  Cash donations are the norm in Congress.  Is it time for new goals? From normal trade in the 1990s and 2000s to excess lobbying and cash donations in the 2010s and 2020s the US-China relationship has changed substantially.  China, the return great power, is focused on economic and military power.  The US, or many in upper class Americans, are also focused on economic power and wealth, a strength and a weakness at the same time.  This makes for a potentially tragic scenario.The author provides numerous detailed examples of cash influence and the exchange of shares in Chinese companies for influence.  In Congress the access to power is apparently open to US citizens and US corporations and foreigners alike.  Policy and votes move one way or another depending on where cash donations flow.  The American people hope for and believe that the country will be the same in the next 50 to 100 years.  There is apparently no vision for 2050, 2100, or the next one hundred or two hundred years.  While some authors write about a better future the actual programs that support freedom, prosperity, and security are few and far between, compared to the advancements in nations with a higher quality of living and better public education.  In the US it is even fashionable among some groups to deny, avoid, and ridicule stronger government and a larger industrial base that are essential to future success.Since there is no national consensus and investment in the long-term future corporations, many families, and the Congress shift one way or another and pursue short-term profits.
