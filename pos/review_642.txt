Excellent! This book should be read by every American, especially those in the media and Congress.  Don't ask President Biden to read it.  The book says his son Hunter is up to his eyeballs in dealings with China. Don't expect members of the Bush family to read it, either.The book is well researched and easy to read. It is full of strong evidence against prominent Americans who either are blind to the danger China poses to the United States or are too greedy to turn down the huge money China offers.
