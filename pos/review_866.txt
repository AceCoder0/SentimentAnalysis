American Government is too proud to learn from History American’s paranoid insecurity against the rise  of 21st century China is the reflection of the US partlack of understanding on China. Our government’s experts on China lack the depth and historical perspective on Chinese history.These experts and powerful Presidents made so many foreign policy mistakes that we wasted thousands of solders’ lives, sacrifices millions of native people and bombed and destroyed countries all for nothing. And we have learnt nothing. That made me angry and sad.
