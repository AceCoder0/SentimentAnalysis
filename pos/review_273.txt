You need to be wise to those who climb the ladder on your back! I read this to enhance my knowledge of one of the workings of those in power. Politics has no conscience-only greed. It isnâ€™t based on the good of all-never on need. If I had two of something I would surely share. Those in power would never dare. That ladder they climb is a tenuous one. Fraught with perks that add up to fun. We put them in power with the push of a button. Most look in the mirror reflecting a glutton.
