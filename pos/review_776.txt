Managed Strategic Competition complements Regional assessments of Multipoliarity In The Avoidable War Rudd sets out his Managed Strategic Competition proposal for avoiding a US China war. He situates his proposal in Xi Jinping's worldview, assessed using his framework consisting of 10 concentric circles.Leaving aside the possibility of a US-China war by mistake, Rudd founds his proposal for managed strategic competition on three core propositions:• USA-China develop a clear understanding of the other's irreducible red lines.• Channel their strategic rivalries into a [globally] competitive race to enhance each's military, economic, and technological capabilities.• Continue strategic cooperation in defined areas of global and national interest.Rudd provides a useful summary of the domestic and global factors influencing XiJP's and China's national, regional, and global reactions to events. Although not deeply argued, the factors are gathered and coherently organized.Ten alternative futures for China-US rivalry are sketched, from the unthinkable a nuclear war to ongoing robust economic competition. Rudd’s managed strategic competition proposal is presented as a mechanism to foster ongoing robust economic competition without descending into war.In an assessment of his proposal’s consequences Rudd endeavors to be even handed and for the most part is. But few words are spent considering the, possibly insurmountable, US attitude changes toward China necessary before his proposal gains US Congressional bipartisan support.Rudd has unique China-US experiences and is the recently announced next Australian Ambassador to the USA when Australia's national interest is a "stable and safe Indo-Pacific."
