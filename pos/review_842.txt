Review by Jerry Woolpy of James Bradley’s The China Mirage: the hidden history of American disaster in Asia Review by Jerry Woolpy of James Bradley’s The China Mirage: the hidden history of American disaster in AsiaMost of us know that our country was misled into invading Iraq by a mistaken president and his misinformed advisers. But what may surprise most of us is that Presidents Teddy Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt, Eisenhower, and Johnson were similarly misled into policies that resulted in wars with Japan, Korea, and Viet Nam that did not have to happen. They misread communications and were totally misled into allying with Chang instead of Mao and Diem instead of Minh. Loaded information came from a college friend of Teddy who became envoy Meiji, China missionaries, China propagandists, and Time magazine. This book tells the history of the roots of our woe begotten relations with Japan, then China, then Korea, then Viet Nam. How the China Lobby in our country bamboozled our people, our government, and all but a few outcaste military, ambassadors, and intelligence officers. It explains how foreign policy may arise from the secret manipulations of presidents behind the backs of experienced officers of State and Defense. By analogy it calls attention to the dangers of foreign interested lobbyists like the AIPAC, and those currently collecting favors from presidential hopefuls like the Clintons; and it warns of the catastrophes that can result from opinion based news like Fox. You may not need to read this book, but our presidents certainly do.
