Another by Edward Rutherfurd I have read all of Edward Rutherfurd's book.  The first one probably over 30 years ago.  This book as well as the others are very enjoyable and informative.  I read a lot of history and much of what is in his books, I have seen before.  Inserting a storyline into real history makes for a pleasurable read.
