really fun to read Rutherford's descriptions of Chinese life, customs, language, history are, as far as I know, true, so the parts I don't know are very convincing.  Surprising to me, the battle scenes were very interesting as well as the personal interactions.  Told through the point of view of several characters, with no simple-minded good guys or bad guys.  I am nearly finished and really don't want the book to end.  I hope he writes a sequel.
