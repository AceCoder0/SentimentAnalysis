Mysteries unveiled Rutherford's China was both a treasure and a challenge for me because I have little background in Eastern cultures and the complexity of the country. This portion of its history offers insights into why its empire failed. The characters that Rutherford creates to deliver the message are memorable.It's not an easy read and took me longer than books of this size normally do, but it was worth it.
