Eye opening involvement of the USA in Asian history. Schoolbooks forgot to mention the involvement of American elite families in the opium trade with China and their involvement in the Opium wars and other severe issues in Asia in the 19/20th. century. The drug problems in Societies at present appear like a cynical reaction of heavans. A very good eye opening summary of Americaâ€˜s involvement in the later Asian history.
