Excellent Background on China's Long-Term Strategy I already had been impressed by how coherent and effective current Chinese strategy is - working its way up the economic value chain, improving first the education of K-12 pupils in coastal areas - then expanding that slowly into the interior while also rapidly building its colleges and universities. All after first having learned basic management and technical skills via foreign investment.However, I'd assumed China's strategy had evolved over time. Details - 'Yes,' but the overall strategy for at least the next half-century was there from the very beginning.What do we do know? China already had a much stronger K-12 education system, is building its tertiary education system, and has large numbers of expatriates who have also developed top-level technical skills/expertise within the U.S. and other nations. Meanwhile, biases against Asians and various sanctions and prohibitions against buying Chinese products and selling high-tech products to China have undoubtedly redoubled its resolve to press onward into dominating A.I. etc. A dangerous 'downside' now is that the U.S. may put China into a corner where it cannot adequately employ its increasingly high-tech workforce without support from Taiwan and its world-leading TSMC.
