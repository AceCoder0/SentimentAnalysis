It was a good book to read as a refresher on 20th century ... It was a good book to read as a refresher on 20th century history related to China and Japan.  However, Bradley jumps to some false conclusions: e.g., the U.S. prompted the war with Japan by cutting off oil and leaving the Japanese military no option other than to attack  Pearl Harbor, or, that if the U.S had responded favorably to Mao's early approaches to the Roosevelt administration, he would not have gone Communist nor would he have aligned China with the Soviet Union, and finally, that Ho Chi Minh, also spurned by the U.S., turned to Communism for lack of an alternative.These are some myths that churned about in the 60's and 70's.  It is odd that Bradley picks these disproven theories as the centerpiece of his "fresh" view of the period.
