Essential reading Lucid, convincing and backed up by thorough research this is is an important book. As the author says from the outset, he is writing as a person deeply committed to China's wellbeing. The urban-rural divide is carefully researched but characterised by good examples. The education picture is invaluable not just for China - indeed this book could be seen as an international blueprint. 186 pages of lucid and convincing narrative analysis, 45 pages of backup notes and indexing. Good standalone, but excellent if written with other detail on China. Highly recommended.
