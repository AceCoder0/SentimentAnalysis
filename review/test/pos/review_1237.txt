Good read, fascinating storylines. Fascinating picture of Americas relationship with China during the past centuries leading up to very recent times.  Does paint a pretty bleak picture of the Roosevelt family which seems pretty factual but likely open to different interpretations.  Overall, thoroughly enjoyable read.
