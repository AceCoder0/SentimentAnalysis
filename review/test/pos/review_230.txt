Required reading for anyone who wants to understand China today This book by the leading American expert on rural China should be required reading for anyone who aspires to understand the challenges China confronts today. The book synthesizes what Scott Rozelle has learned in 40 years of field research in literally all parts of China. He emphasizes the dangers to national stability resulting from underinvestment in education of the two-thirds of China's population in rural areas who are unprepared to compete in today's China labor market which demands ever higher skill levels as low wage, unskilled jobs move off shore to lower wage economies like Vietnam and India. He fears that unless the Government of China addresses this gap quickly and aggressively, there is a risk that young Chinese males, who can find neither employment nor a spouse, turning to lives of crime.
