A great book!! The author has done his homework, and discusses what he has learned There are many things in this selection that will be obvious to the reader; on the other hand, there are a myriad of items and discussions that will not be apparent to the average reader, and which should be discussed by all of us. How the Chinese government works should be reviewed by all of us, even as they change the rules to suit themselves.
