Mere Cheerleading for the British Conquest of China This book is not about China, but about how and why the British brought China to its knees from 1840 onward. The title could be Britain's Glorious Asian Adventures. The only real character exploration is done for Western characters, particularly the British that Rutherford understands. The Chinese characters are merely stick figures made from a bundle of stereotypes constituting character flaws. The prejudice is as palpable as dinner conversation at a British colonial club in Asia. The depiction of China is as authentic as food from a West End Panda Express.I read and enjoyed both London and Sarum. Rutherford is clearly at his best writing about his own country and people. What he has done to the Chinese in this book is very hard to read. I have not seen prejudicial characterizations of this kind in years. Just for the readers information, I lived over a decade in Hong Kong and have studied the same history that Rutherford pretends to cover. Another less prejudicial historical fiction narrative you might try if you are interested in the British takeover of the Middle Kingdom is the trilogy from Amitav Ghosh about the Opium Wars.
