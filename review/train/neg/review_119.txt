Rutherford should stick to European history I love long, well-researched, well-written historical novels..sadly this was not such a novel.  The fact that Mr. Rutherford would focus so much on the European colonialists and try to paint them in some kind noble light was bad enough, but his descriptions of China were simply one-dimensional and his most of the Chinese characters bordered on cartoonish.  With 1000s of years of history that he would chose this small slice of China, basically the the empire in decline is very telling. Rutherford should stick to European history as he seems to have no understanding of China or any real desire to learn.
