A bit long but very revealing Although some of the chapters were too long and could have been sub headed or split overall I found the book very revealing. Revealing not only about China but the West as well.The Great Leap Forward, The Cultural Revolution, Tianamen Square, the list goes on and on. For none of these atrocities has China been made to pay any price. As long as China will contibute to our politicians campaigns, finance our debt and satisfy our need for cheap consumer items readily availble at the neighborhood "mart" what do we care what the PRC does, or did to it's own people, the vast majority of which will never see a dime of the riches reaching Beijing, Shanghai, or Hong Kong.My late father always claimed that WWW III could well be the U.S. and Russia versus China. That military scenario may never occur, but I would venture that we are at war with China already, we are just too busy spending our selves to defeat to know we are fighting it. We ignore Mao at our peril, he once told Russia "...kill milions of us, there will be millions more waiting behind every tree when you invade..." Those words now are "spend your dollars with us, we have billions of yuans with which to buy you."
