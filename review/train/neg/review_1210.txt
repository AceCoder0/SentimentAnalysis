naive author Book started out with interesting history and a revealing  interesting analysis of Asian politics. The incompetency of western diplomacy and meddling was not surprising--FDR was even a bigger bungler than I had assumed. I take issue with the author on a few important aspects. He seems rather naive in thinking that just because Mao and Ho Chi Min claimed they wanted to cuddle up with the US in favor of the USSR doesnt mean they were sincere. Communists have always lied to get aid and to placate gullible leaders. If you need proof look at how Stalin played the US all throughout the war and ended up at Yalta getting all of Eastern Europe by telling FDR that his intentions were benign. I have been to Viet Nam and heard the stories of murder and starvation after the Communists took over-most people hated the regimeOnce they saw what it really stood for. Not the promise of nationalism but brutal dictatorship. Chiang kai-shekWas a flawed leader but he built a prosperous and proud country in Taiwan (having personally been there recently).The author is caught up in the Leftist hatred of anybody that opposed Communism and ignoring that recent KGB and Venona documents prove that there were many Communist agents and sympathizers in the FDR administration ie. Hopkins, White, Currie, Hess and many more. Read the book byRomerstein and Stanton for more details.The Communists killed and enslaved millions but the author get more angry at McCarthy? Typical...
