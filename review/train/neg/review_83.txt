Sonnygillis@gmail .com Enjoyed and learned a lot but didnâ€™t LOVE like all other Rutherford books I have read and reread many times. Each and every one he wrote! More than once each book.PerhappsI related more to the others. He is gifted and wonderful. Like Michener another all time favorite! Thank you Rutherford!
