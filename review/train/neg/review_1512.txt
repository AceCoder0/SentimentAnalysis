Reads like a long newspaper article This book is poorly organized, poorly edited, and reads like a long newspaper article: high on sensationalist language but low on solid content. The author seems to have picked up snippets of information about the Chinese Communist Party during his time as a news reporter in China, but has not done systematic research on the Party. It feels like the superficial reporting that comes from a foreign reporter on a limited period assignment who does not understand the language or the culture in which he is reporting.
