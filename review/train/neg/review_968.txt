Simply Awful According to James Bradley, all Americans involved with China were either drug lords or dullards. At least until 1941, because I quit reading the book at that point. His very unbalanced view adds nothing new to the study of the period, which has been done better elsewhere. What he does do is describe Asian-American relations in an often mocking and always painful-to-read style. Don't buy this book. I would let you have mine, but that would just be mean.
