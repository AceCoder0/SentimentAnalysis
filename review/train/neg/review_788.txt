Avoid This is a peculiar book. It begins, in a measured tone, warning of the dangers of a conflict between America and China. It ends the same way with a warning that there is a risk that countries can talk themselves into a war. It lists the dangers of misunderstanding each other’s intentions. All that seems fine, but The bulk of the book from Chapter three to Chapter Seventeen has nothing but warnings as to what China has achieved in recent years, and that this is not good because that is seriously challenging America’s global power. In short, this book written by a former Prime Minister of Australia, is a long letter to America to wake up.To make sense of the title of this book, one has to read a sub-text: Only if America remains so powerful that China cannot challenge it. The book holds a negative view of China’s development and progress at every front – and contains subtle criticism at almost everything China. There is hardly anything mentioned of America to hold a balance here. In the occasional instances in which America is mentioned, it is to point out where it is lagging behind China. So, the lack of a balanced view makes this a book of limited enlightenment.
