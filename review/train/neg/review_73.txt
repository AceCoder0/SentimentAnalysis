Well written, but not a sweeping epic. I have read all of Rutherford's other novels, and I was thrilled to see this latest released, but it fell short of my expectations. I was hoping for a sweeping epic across centuries... or at least a century. Instead this was a novel of a comprssed history of a few decades. It was worth reading and was well-written, if not slow at some points.
