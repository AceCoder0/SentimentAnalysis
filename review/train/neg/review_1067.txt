Author's Views on Mao are a Disgrace The author says that the reason that communist China has became skeptical and even aggressive towards American interests is because America rejected Mao, who, according to the author, wanted to reach out to America.  This is complete nonsense.  For one thing, America had reason for rejecting Mao.  Communists like Mao have harmed millions of people all over the world.  Mao literally killed millions of Chinese with his communist ideology.  Americans can have a sense of pride that we rejected Mao and wanted nothing to do with him until Richard Nixon embraced him.  Chang, the nationalist leader of China, fled to Taiwan.  The author suggests that we should never have been friends with Chang and that Mao was a far better leader.  All we have to do is look at how Taiwan turned out to see that we were right to stand with Chang, and not Mao.  Taiwan has a representative government, capitalism, a much higher standard of living than mainland China, and they produce high-quality products.
