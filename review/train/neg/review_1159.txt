But where's the military component ? The author writes a thorough summary of how (and why) China arrived at this point. But the remedies he offers for the U.S. conspicuously omits THE one thing dictatirships most fear: An unbeatable military. Five thousand years of history confirm this. It is why China itself is racing towards military  superpower status. Including nukes. Beijing isn't  just relying on economic hegemony or "soft power".  So why has the author ignored the obvious need for a stronger American military ?  Because it doesn't fit the narrative of the progressive wing of the political party he's a member of.
