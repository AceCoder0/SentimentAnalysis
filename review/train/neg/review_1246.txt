Opinionated but fast pace "historical" telling of Sino-American relation This book is one of the most opinionated "historical" account of Sino-American relation. James espouses a theory without proof that if US supported Mao, that China civil war and Korean War and Vietnam War would not have happened; and that China would not have expansion ambitions.  Well, we are here today and China IS expanding into islands south of Japan and South China Sea, and using their economic muscle to mine the world's minerals. Mr. Bradley is indeed naive in his book as the US was naive at the time. While it is indeed true that the China Lobby conned the US, they were just smart at their game that is now normal occurrence. One thing I thought was ironic was that US wanted to make China a Christian nation and to expand trade, and had a critical role in feeding opium to the Chinese, whereas today China is exporting goods and illicit drugs to the US.  My how the tables have turned.
