Very Strange Book - The author's premise is that low education levels in most of China will preclude it from getting past the Middle-Income trap. However, my understanding from reading numerous books about China is that its coastal areas (about 280 million) and less-populated areas are very different. The coastal area is very well educated, highly productive, and now has trouble finding jobs for those with college educations. China has a history of first trying out new approaches in a few limited areas (usually its coastal area) and it would make sense for it to continue such. Ergo, there will be no problem with lack of education when China further upgrades is coastal areas - scene of decades of amazing success.
