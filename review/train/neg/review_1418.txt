Should be 2.5 stars, but can’t bring myself to give it 3. Interesting story tainted by Bradley’s overwhelming bias. His two main arguments are first,  that America has no idea what is actually going on in China (which I’m inclined to agree with), and second, Mao good, Chiang bad. This later position is extremely over argued, and is punctuated by wild accusations and opinions stated as fact. He lost all credibility pretty early on for me.There is also an insinuation that America’s wealth is built upon the the mid 19th century opium trade in China (x, y and z family made ALL their money in opium originally, and then they turned around to use that money investing in the industrialization of America; seriously).
