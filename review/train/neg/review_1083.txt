Very biased book, lots of misinterpretation of facts This is a fundamentally misleading book. As a Chinese American, I have read many books about Sino-American policy, history and relationship, both in English and Chinese. The author bases his judgement on the wrong assumption that Communists in China were eager to make friends with America and did not realize that it was just part of their systematic and deceiving propaganda. I am very disappointed that even today, there are still so-called experts like James Bradley who believe the talks of one of the biggest liars in the history-Mao, and put his quotation on the beginning of the book as evidence of truth.
