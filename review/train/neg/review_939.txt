Try something else about China and the West More a polemic than anything. I'm about 100 pages into it. The history is interesting - so far,especially the history of Chinese in the American west - but he's on a tear against the West in China, and, to some extent, in Japan and Korea, and he makes no bones about it. There is no nuance or balance or perspective; it's like reading the trolls' comments online. I bought the book so I'll finish it, but I don't like the way he's writing this at all.
