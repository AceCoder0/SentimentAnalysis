The Title should have been "Opium" !! I devoured all of Rutherfurd's books, couldn't wait for China.  Oh my, what a disappointment.  Only 100 pages in but doesn't want to get any better.  I wanted history - from the beginning - like Sarum, or New York, or , or ......Maybe we can entice Mr. Follett to do a Chinese  Tom the Builder.  What a treat that would be !!
