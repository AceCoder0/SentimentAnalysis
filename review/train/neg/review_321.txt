Another one of “those” books! This is yet another of those quickly-produced, quick-buck kind of formulaic books we see all the time from guys like this, and Hannity, and Levin, and Coulter, etc. I’m a right-winger, but I’m honest and will call a spade a spade. These books are mass-produced, and slapped together quickly to strike while the iron is hot. They’re usually about 250 pages and they’re full of endnotes, references, and quotes. The reference section at the end of the book is usually about one-fourth of the book’s volume. Also, these books never really break any new ground or give you any new, mind-blowing information. I pretty much knew most of this stuff already. And lastly, despite the revelations brought forth in these kinds of books, it never leads to any of these crooked politicians getting indicted, or removed from office, or impeached, so what good is it for? Absolutely nothing!
