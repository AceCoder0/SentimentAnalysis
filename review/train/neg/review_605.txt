Garbage tinfoil opportunism What a garbage book. It is an opportunistic play to try to get gullible people who already "believe" certain biases to spend their (very little) money on a book that just falsely confirms their bias. It is, at best, an echo chamber for the minority population of the United States - the same ones who think there was a rigged election (even though it has been proven to not have been over and over gain), who think the world is flat, and that vaccines deliver a microchip nano technology that only exists in the Star Trek movies.
