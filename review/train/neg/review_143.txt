A valued perspective and understanding of the path leading to modern day China China is the latest in Rutherfurd's series of historical novels, and China fits well within them. The story is set in the final 80 years or so of dynastic China and follows the western powers contribution to the destruction and exploitation of the empire. I was repulsed by the inevitable comparison I could not help but make of western "trade" to today's drug cartels. While China was more than capable of self-destruction, western means of exploitation certainly sped the process and did much damage some of which impoverishes us to the current day.. The story is told primarily through the eyes of a British trader, John Trader, whose life and death encompasses the period of the novel, and a member China's royal court that was a close, personal servant of empress Cixi whose life also encompasses the same period. I found myself unable to get overly attached to any of the characters this time around; however, I feel the book gave me a valued perspective and understanding of the path leading to modern day China and associated problems and attitudes the world must struggle through today.
