Brilliant and inspiring! Thank you this very enlightening book. Serendipitously, I discovered it just before a trip to the Chinese Embassy, to view The Justice and Peace photo exhibit of the relationship between China and the U.S. During WWII. I hope leaders of both countries will read this beautifully written, and easy to understand, book so that we may learn from the past and never repeat the experiences.
