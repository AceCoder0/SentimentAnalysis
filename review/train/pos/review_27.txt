Very interesting book but doesn't span entire Chinese history I read many of Edward Rutherford's books and enjoyed the history and the engaging characters.  This book is no different.  The stories are entertaining and the history of China in the 19th. century is described in detail.What is different from the author's other books is that this book covers only 70 years of  more than 5000 years of Chinese history.  It doesn't really follow multiple generations of family which is the hallmark of Rutherford's books.That's the reason for the 4 star review.
