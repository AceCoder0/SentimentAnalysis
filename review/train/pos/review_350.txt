Every American should read this Holy moly.  I was stunned at the greed and self serving interests- way beyond what I expected.  This book is easy to read as each chapter is devoted to a different corrupt, lifelong politician.  Every American should read this book-even just one chapter.  Pick an Elite  and prepare to be absolutely disgusted.
