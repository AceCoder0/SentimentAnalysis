Intriguing Read James Bradley has written THE must read book for anyone interested in the history of Chinese American politics before, during, and after WWII. While in the military I was stationed in the military on Taiwan during the late 60's and was only aware of the current state of affairs between Mao Zedong and Chiang Kai-shek as reported by the American press. Reading The China Mirage it became clear to me just how that press and the pro Chiang lobby influenced and dominated FDR's asian policy resulting in many bad decisions that would affect our country for decades. As Bradley writes in this book: "In retrospect, Stilwell's advice could well have resulted in a lasting friendship between China and the United States, saved millions of lives, and adverted the Chinese civil war, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War". Intriguing.
