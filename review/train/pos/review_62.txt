China Charm and Chaos I read without hesitation, everything this author writes. China is an excellent addition to his list of enthralling historical novels. An eye-opening and informative account begins in 1839 and approaches modern times.  Wonderful characters fully developed in intriguing historical setting.  I enjoyed every page. Though I know it will be a while, I'm eager to read Rutherfurd's next offering.
