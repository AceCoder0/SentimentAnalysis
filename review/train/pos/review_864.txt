A study of the willful ignorance of America towards Asia. This book points out the many failures over 150+ year history of US policy in China and in Asia. It also bring to light just how deep many of the US political and economic icons were involved in the opium trade to make their fortunes. But most of all it points out the folly of getting your intelligence from biased and often totally ignorant sources, such as the Christian evangelists in the pre-1950 eras who had very close ties to Washington.The book is not perfect - it tends to gloss over a bit on other outside factors, such as Stalin, but since this is a book about China and Asia, I would not expect it to delve deep into those aspects.
