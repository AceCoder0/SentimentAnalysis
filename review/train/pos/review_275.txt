very good information--very technical This book made me angry!  It is so sad our politicians sell us out like they do. I read the book more slowly than usual--due to the names being foreign to me.  My head was spinning with all the connections and payoffs.  Peter lays out a lot of information and has many footnotes to back up what he says.  I hope indictments come out of this, but the swamp in DC (esp with the DOJ being so corrupt) will probably never do anything about the information. I got sick reading it.  Some of the information was familiar but now I have the details and am beginning to understand the depth of the money flow and corruption of our political class and businesses.  The CCP is everywhere.  No one seems to be doing much about it.
