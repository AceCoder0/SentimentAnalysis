In Some Ways, Not a Typical Rutherfurd Novel I generally love Edward Rutherfurd novels when I’m in the mood for them (which is not all the time).  His works of historical fiction are so Rutherfurdian that it’s generally pretty easy to recognize one.  He picks a place (Ireland, New York, Paris, etc.) and takes us back to the very beginning.  He creates a few families and traces them through many generations at key points in the place’s history, ultimately bringing them to the modern day.  It’s all very obviously constructed, and built in books that are very long.  Sometimes that’s just what one wants.That’s why this book is a bit of a surprise.  I couldn’t imagine how Rutherfurd could cover the history of China.  It’s quite outside of his anglo-centric comfort zone.  Turns out, he didn’t cover the history of China.  He starts less than 200 years ago with the events leading up to the Opium Wars and takes us only into the first years of the twentieth century.  Of course, though he does trace a few Chinese characters (the eunuch Lacquer Nail being the best), this allows him to keep his focus on the English traders’ and missionaries’ view of the country.  It’s a bit of a copout.Still, it is a big book and most of those Rutherfurdian qualities are there.  He does a deep dive, and it is interesting to get a view of China’s encounter with the West, forcing conflict between the traditional values of the country and the need to modernize in the face of threat.  For anyone who thinks of China as Mao and communism, it would open eyes.  Still, it’s not quite what I hope for from a Rutherfurd novel.
