strong story Rutherford does a good job at research on his books.  I do think he tends to get a bit lost in his books 70% in.  The story get a bit old, and the connection between the 1st  400 page and the last 50 pages tends to get a bit dry.  Overall though i do enjoy the depths and sagas be presents.
