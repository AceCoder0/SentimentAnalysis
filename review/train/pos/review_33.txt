Rutherfurd is a Master of Historical Fiction Rutherfurd has never disappointed before, and again, with China, he meets every expectation of one of the great writers of historical fiction. China is all we hope it will be; sweeping, multigenerational, tragic, triumphant, and as with all Rutherfurd novels, comes complete full circle. If I was alone in the world with a room full of his novels, I could live out my days in complete happiness. With China, your mind is captivated by many varied characters and stories as the hands of time turn. The reader is taken back, and moved forward as events unfold. We are always made more aware, more in tune to history with a Rutherfurd novel, and I am almost sad to end one with the completion of reading. If only it could go on endlessly. He is undisputedly a master of his trade and one of the greatest of the greats.
