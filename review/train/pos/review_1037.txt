Must Read for Americans Mr. Bradley has done a brilliant job of compiling and making a readable account of America's involvement with China over many decades. He has touched all the key events and people. I was amazed to find how powerful the China lobby was in influencing and directing our foreign policy moves in the 1940s. This is a book which should be require reading in colleges teaching American history. The author suggests we might avoided fighting in both Korea and Vietnam had we listened to State Dept. experts who sadly were removed due to McCarthy's witch hunt. Imagine how different our nation would be had we never fought in either place. Overall a fabulous book even if you have no interest in our diplomatic history. It is a gem.
