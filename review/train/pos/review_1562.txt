Many Small Stories Inside an Informative Book This is a very informative and thorough look at modern China and the dominant role played by the Communist party in China's political and business activities. McGregor paints the picture of a party obsessed with control and information by telling many individual stories based on interviews he conducted. This means that some chapters are more interesting than others in part because of the individuals McGregor could locate for interviews. Chapters 2 and 7 which focus on Chinese enterprise were particularly interesting whereas chapter 3 on party personnel was a slog. McGregor is a serious journalist who provides lots of information without injecting his personal views.  Thus "The Party" is not one the many recent books on China that are intended to scare or enrage rather than inform readers.The reliance on interviews does make for a book that feels "zoomed in" on particular people and issues, rather than a comprehensive and broad look at China and the party as a whole. Nonetheless, this is still a very clear window into how China works and I recommend it alongside other books like "Capitalism Without Democracy" and "The Beijing Consensus" that are equally helpful in understanding modern China.
