For the Serious Student of China In his book "The Party," veteran Financial Times reporter Richard MacGregor presents a disturbing but very true argument:  Now entirely devoid of its ideological and revolutionary roots, China's Communist Party is intent on clinging onto power by keeping on a tight leash China's most powerful institutions -- the state-owned enterprises, all branches of government, the military, and the financial sector -- and it is this very disruption of the machinery of state and economy that is leading to malfunction and malfeasance in China today.The Party accomplishes this with its system of political commissars so that every institution in China has two competing centers of power -- an executive who is responsible for the competent management of the enterprise, and a political secretary who is responsible for the ideological loyalty and orthodoxy of the enterprise.  Invariably these two goals are in conflict with each other.  Competence requires openness, tolerance, diversity, transparency, accountability, and merit -- principles and ideas that stand counter to Party orthodoxy.  And so while Chinese state-owned enterprises and the Chinese military look like behemoths to the outside world, it's this very inconsistency and contradiction that weakens their ability to compete on a global scale.
