China I have read all of Edward Rutherford 's books.  This  book took awhile to get started with the story. Not like his former literary accomplishments. Sarum was his first book I read 30 years ago. I loved it and was anxious to read more of his work. I waited patiently for China but it didn't  .meet up to my expectations.
