A not very helpful conclusion for a very helpful book. I have read Rudd's February article, "Short of War", in Foreign Affairs and watched the recent video at the Asian Society of Rudd and Ian Bremmer, both about the book. In both, Rudd concluded: "May the best system win."In a geopolitical struggle between two strongly endowed competitors, the US and China, this is not helpful toward avoiding war.  I would like to think and wish: May both systems thrive and serve their people well.  Serving the people well is the proper task of government under any system and the surest way to help avoid war.As you read the book, try to see if it would be plausible to imaging the US and China in a contest to serve each's people better.  In this case, no one has to lose.
