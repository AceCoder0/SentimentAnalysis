Choose your role models in current times carefully. The content of this book is the very reason why it isn't being discussed in media anywhere. A thorough investigation which is spread across Europe, East Asia, Ukraine and the corridors of power in Washington DC. No matter what political party you support, you are not spared. And also don't fall for the ultra rich, virtue signaling celebrities as well. For those who followed/are following the 2020 HBiden Laptop scandal, please do read this book as well. Thanks to Peter Schweizer for this fantastic piece of investigation, where no mercy is shown on anyone.
