The Seduction of the USA It is a pity that history is not taught from the standpoint of dynamics between societies, and nations, actions and consequences that play out over centuries.This is a little-known tale of the  exploitation of China by certain factions of American traders who rode the coattails of British imperialists who, for purely monetary reasons, initiated the opium trade.  Actually the trade began as a simple smuggling operation on a vast scale, until what there was of the Chinese monarchy rebelled, and were repulsed by military action.  There is mention of the opium wars during the late 19th century, but the details have not routinely been explained as well as they are in this book.  The opium wars are only an opening.What is described in this book is the seduction of influential Americans by factions in China's nationalist movement.  The seducers were brought to, and burrowed their way into influential social circles through the good intentions of missionaries.  The seducers exploited a power block in China, that could maintain itself by continuously wooing deluded American political figures, and policy makers.  This is the basis of the drama, the eventual consequences are disastrous, and the dynamics of those foreign policy sleight-of-hands led to many major disasters of the 20th Century.From 1853, and the forced opening of Japan to the west by the United States, and the wooing of powerful figures by the Japanese "wards" fifty years later, through World War II, to Vietnam, there is woven a sickening tale of unrealized blunders and delusions, unintentional betrayals, and bitter enemies sowed therefrom.
