Informative - McGregor's "The Party" provides important insight into how China operates. Membership in the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) exceeds 73 million (about 12% of adults), and controls every level of government, as well as official religions, the media, large, state-owned businesses, and the various other allowed political parties. Ironically, the CCP came into power as a result of popular abhorrence of corruption, and it is now likewise riddled itself. Its foundation has move from preaching equality to allowing incomes as unequal as anywhere in Asia, and from despising to enabling business leaders. Nonetheless, the World Bank credits China with lowering the number of its poor by one-half billion from 1981 to 2004. Star students and wealthy entrepreneurs are sought out for CCP membership.Public institution officials receive periodic training from a network of 2,800 schools before becoming eligible for promotion; accusations of criminal conduct are first investigated by the Party, and it decides whether to take action. Leaders and budgets of the 8 approved 'democratic parties' are set by the CCP. Things that formerly required Party approval (where one lives, works, studies, marries) have largely become acts of choice in urban areas, less so in rural zones.Corruption is a major problem, especially in Shanghai, possibly because it has become a socialism showcase. Positions in customs, taxation, land sales, infrastructure development, procurement, and regulation are especially vulnerable.
