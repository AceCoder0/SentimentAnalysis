One of the best books on US-China, from THE expert on this topic Highly recommend this book to anyone who would like to understand more on US-China relationships, where and why it has gotten here and where it ought to and might go next.Kevin is THE thought leader, observer and player in global political scene, with direct interactions and keen observations combined with thoughtful analysis, based on first hand experience with many of the key players and leaders today.Kudos to having constructed a thoughtful framework on Managed Strategic Competition, one has to provide a peaceful pathway for co-existence without breaking into an all-out war.Rare to read a book that has distilled his years of lectures and talks on this topic, and points towards clear scenarios and outcomes for intelligent people to look beyond current impulsive behaviors and actions driven by insecurity, to rationally chart a course of action based on potential optimal future outcomes.Hope this book reaches those who are able to influence decisions, directly or indirectly, that makes the key relationships work for a sustainable future and benefit of all.
