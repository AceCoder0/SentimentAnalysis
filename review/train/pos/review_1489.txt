Very well written and in-depth This book is a good example of how a book about political science and economic factors can be made interesting. while giving an in-depth overview of the players within the power circles in China, it also touches on some history and background of how some of the most important players came to be in their positions. The author gives just enough personal stories and anecdotes to make reading a bit more interesting than most books about historical subjects. I recommend this book for anyone who has an interest in learning more about how China has quickly risen to become one of the most important economic and political entities now on the world stage..
