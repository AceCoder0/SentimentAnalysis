Necessary read to understand assumptions about politics and U.S. Asian policy. This fascinating work has caused me to reconsider many things I thought I knew about China.One small correction the editors need to correct in subsequent reprintings was on p. 330 of my hardcopy.  American bombers under the command of Curtis LeMay that conducted the fire raids on Tokyo were B-29s, not B-52's.  B-52's were part of the US nuclear strike forces under LeMay's command during the Cold War.
