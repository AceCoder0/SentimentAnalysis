Another great story from Rutherford This book came in pristine condition. The story sweeps you across colonial China when the opium trade was ramping up, but then it delves past that into the lives of his characters. I feel that I learn something from Edward Rutherford books. In this I learned about the tumultuous upheaval in China during the later half of 19th c. to the early 20th c. thru a villager, a trader, missionaries and a eunuch. Very interesting.
