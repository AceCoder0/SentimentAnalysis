Well documented . This book was hard for me to keep reading as I got really disgusted by all the politicians , big business leaders, and former military personnel who have and continue to profit from Chinese ties.  It is an eye opener and really should be at least skimmed over by all voters, It also shows a dire need for political reform in the way of term limits for congress along with penalties for those who profit from government positions via foreign money.
