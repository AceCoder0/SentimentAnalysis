Good Read This is a good book, and donâ€™t let anyone tell you otherwise. Even my least favorite Rutherford was worth reading. His characters were rich, the setting descriptions opulent, and I wish there was more about food. I would recommend this novel, if nothing else for the massive information and research that went into it. Greatly appreciated- keep writing!
