A Great read There are many books out there on China and on Chinese Communism. Most of them deal with the 20th century and end before 2000. Most are broad stroke histories and rarely get into the nitty gritty of the party workings. Then along comes 'The Party', one of the best contemporary histories of modern China and of the Party that runs China. It goes a long way to giving you the best possible understanding of the current Chinese political system, also why and how it operates. Albeit from a western perspective, you still find out more about the reasons behind the Party's decision making process than in other publications.Well written and simple to digest, if you were thinking of doing business or moving to work in China, this is a perfect book for anybody wanting to get to grips with it's system.My only gripe is that I think it could have been a little longer. It also leaves out some important subjects like Falun Gong, North Korea and Fishing boat disputes in the sea of Japan.That said, it's still possibly the best buy on the subject currently so I highly recommend it to anybody interested.
