Valuable insight into US-China relations This is a great, must-read book! Mr. Rudd explains the history and dynamics influencing US-China relations from a well-informed and unbiased perspective. It's well-written, timely and thought-provoking. I hope it becomes widely read among our leaders responsible for managing this complex relationship. I've sent copies to friends and relatives.
