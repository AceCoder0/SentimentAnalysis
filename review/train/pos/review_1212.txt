False news tricked America to support wrong Chinese leader This is Brady's best of his explanation of the causes of the WWII in the Pacific.  He motivated me to reread Tuchman's classic on Stillwell and American Experience in China. Brady's in depth work and fearlessly writing truth of how even FDR was manipulated in to supporting a ruthless, corrupt Chiang which set up our failed foreign policy for the next 30 years is well done. Anyone that truly wants to understand America's involvement in Asia throughout the 19th and 20th century should read all four of Brady's masterpieces.
