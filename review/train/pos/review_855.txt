Fantastic read, truly challenges the status quo Growing up, I read stories of heroic American bravery in WWII and later wars. As I got older, I started to notice inconsistencies between the values America publicly espoused and what we displayed in Korea and Vietnam. After I became close with two Chinese students this year, I remembered the axiom, “if I know you better than you know me,  I can control the conversation,” and decided it was time I became better informed on China.This book was an excellent starting point, as it dug into the ways that American policy from the 1880s influences our Asian relations today. It also opened my eyes to a world of conspiracy that drove the decisions America took in Asia.Informative, and applicable to the current political situations, I highly suggest this book.
