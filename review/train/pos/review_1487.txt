Excellent description of the communist party role, function, and major disfunction in China. Finally someone explained the current role and methods of the communist party in China. Many Americans think the communist party is sort of a benign grandfather offering sage advice to the Chinese. As this book makes clear it is all about deception. There is absolutely NO rule of law in China -- the laws are just a front for outsiders. There is almost no freedom of thought or expression in China. Communism is just another failed religion maintained by totalitarianism. Think Spanish Inquisition on steroids. Bound to fail.
