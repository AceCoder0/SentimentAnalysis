Some good stuff here There's a lot of interesting opinion and historical perspective here, I also enjoyed the early part of the book and the historical background.  The Delano family history was very interesting and TR's affection for Japan - to the detriment of Korea (rather shocking).  What was missing was any discussion of the communist influence in the Roosevelt administration and how that influenced/didn't influence FDR's policy towards China.
