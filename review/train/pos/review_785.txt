Constructive Having a tremendous knowledge about China, the Western World and international politics; Kevin Rudd deep dives into the evolutions of Chinaâ€™s geopolitic relationships & position against the current world order. His detailed road lights and constructive suggestions about avoiding a catastrophic war between US & China are distilled wisdom droplets that may sustain global stabilization in the first half of the 21st century. The Avoidable War is a successful book that I strongly recommend.
