Completely new light and penetrating angle on this important subject This book reveals so many profound but deeply (and deliberately?) hidden facts underlying the US-China history.  I recommend it to whoever takes a more than casual interest in this all-important topic, to take the message of this book to heart.  It will define the future of America, if not the world.This book did not disappoint me!
