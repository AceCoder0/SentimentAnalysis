A nice primer but in need of an update This is a great book for those who want a solid overview of the history of the Chinese Communist Party and how it has evolved its operations within the political, social, and economic spheres in China. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, there is much less understanding out there at how "the Party" and the government are separate entities in a communist system and who does what in society, and this is tailored to show how the system evolved distinctly in China. There are however more current books out there that may be better suited to the specialist looking for what's changing today in China. Would be interesting to see an update of this 2012 edition, with a chapter or two added on the tail end about Xi's consolidation of power and how this impacts the Party today.
