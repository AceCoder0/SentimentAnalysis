SCHWEIZER DOES IT AGAIN Peter Schweizer has done it again with a expose of a Government run by elites who become rich from their ties to the very people they were elected or appointed to protect us from. He then takes us to the entertainment and sports elites who have become wealthy beyond our dreams and who bow down to foreign leaders who wish to one day take over our country. One example is LeBron James who refuses to call out China for their treatment of ethnic groups as he is heralded as an idol in China. Schweizer brings us up to date on the Biden Crime Family and how they have become wealthy from their ties to China and Ukraine. However, he presents a fair and balanced book by including members of both parties who have benefited from their previous and current positions. He includes the Bush family, the Trudeau family, the Pelosi's, Kissinger, Gates, McConnell's, Clinton's, etc, who are all recipients of great wealth thanks to China and other foreign powers and Schweizer spells out how it is done. He also digs into big tech, Ivy League universities, and Wall Street. Kissinger once stated, "When the Chinese don't need us, they are going to be very difficult to deal with." We are getting very close to the time when China will have reaped all they can from America; their goal is 2049. Please read this book to see some suggestions from Schweizer on how to turn this around. I'm hoping it's not too late and that someone is listening.
