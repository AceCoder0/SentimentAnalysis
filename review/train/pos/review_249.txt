Highly recommend This book is co-authored by Professor Rozelle who has conducted extensive research on rural China for the last 40 years. Issues about rural China are not widely known outside of China, but they do give a measure of where China stands today: a middle-income country struggling to find its way towards prosperity. Brilliant book, very well articulated, I recommend it to anyone interested in knowing more about China.
