Our Governments Has Not Pa id Attention to Local Experts Before Well written about an episode in our history in which the Federal government had no idea about what was really going on in Asia, much like the current government doesn't believe the FBI and CIA.  Previously the result was our disfunctional relationship with China, the Chinese civil war, the Korean War, and the Viet Nam War.  Let's hope that the current government's belief that they know better than the intelligence experts doesn't result in as many horrors!
