Well-documented and highly informative This book provides information not readily available from the "mainstream" media.  Extensively researched and footnoted, it brings to light the patterns of shady dealings by some of America's highest-level officials and business leaders.  These are people whose actions (when uncovered) may seem merely incompetent or irrational, but below the surface are designed to line the pockets and further the objectives of business and political elites while tearing down the overall fabric of American society.  This is not an unsubstantiated hatchet job by some hack or nut case, but instead a clear documentation of events which have been cloaked in secrecy by the perpetrators and the media to the detriment of the general public.
