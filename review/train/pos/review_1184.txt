For 150 years the story of our government's policy toward China has been a hoax. This is a must read. James Bradley has written one of the most compelling stories of history that makes one rethink the entire approach of the U.S. foreign policy toward Asia since the days of the Opium Wars.  He convincingly, although I'm sure controversially to many, describes how for decades we favored the Japanese over the Chinese, supported corruption for years in China and then by the decisions of a few of the "wisest" men in government and while FDR was out of the country, changed foreign policy toward Japan that may have led to the attack on Pearl Harbor. He continues the history through how we fought in Korea and how it could have been avoided to how we got into Viet Nam, again a conflict that was unnecessary. If he did not support every statement in great detail, one could easily read this book as one great conspiracy theory, but it is difficult to refute the history that he explores.  If you have any interest in history and current events and want to have a much better understanding of how our relationship with China and Southeast Asia developed and how it could have been much different, I would strongly encourage you to read this book.Bradley is a good writer and this is by no means a dry read but if I were the editor there are sections of the book I would have shortened and others could have been expanded.  This is one book where I did not want it to end.  There is so much to tell and I hope Mr. Bradley will write a sequel to bring us up to today.  As I write, we are in the transition period of a new administration which could have profound effects on our foreign policy.  Without understanding where we have been and the mistakes we have made as a country in our policies toward Southeast Asia, it is unlikely that our new relationships with this important area of the world will be anything but destructive and lead to further hostility and economic strife.
