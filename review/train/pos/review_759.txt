RED AMERICA There is no pleasant way to describe cancer and how it effects the body. But that is exactly what has happened to the body of America. This book pretty much confirms and documents what I have believed and witnessed for well over 35 years, though it has been going on for closer to 60 years, maybe more. I am totally convinced there is no turning back because our politicians (of both parties) and corporate America have been drinking the red cool-aid for too long.Made in America has been replaced with MADE IN CHINA.So how should we Americans look at this cancerous body that we no longer recognize? Let me put it this way....things are not falling apart, they are falling into place. Just as Jesus said they would.
