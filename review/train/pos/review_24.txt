China: The Novel is a Firework China: The Novel is another epic wonder from one of my favorite authors. The novel opens in the first half of the Nineteenth Century, at the beginning of the First Opium War. Rutherfurd introduces his masterful characters consisting of a diverse blend of Chinese families and British and American fortune-hunters and missionaries.I found an interesting perspective of the many cultural differences between China and the Western countries. As I was reading, the shocking acts of bullying and murder lulled me into adopting the Western idea that our societal differences were vast. In thinking about it further, I saw similarities to the West in the casual abuse and outright oppression of the poor and working class. Additionally, I considered the continuing conquest of India and other countries by the British and the full force of the institution of slavery in America. The backyards of the West were abysmally untidy.The military engagements and the fight over international trade in China were not new topics to me, but I think I might be somewhat of an exception in this case. That said, Rutherfurd memorably depicts the conflicts with the well-developed characters populating the story. Armed with knowing some facts about this piece of history, I came away with a richer understanding of the events and now think about them from different viewpoints.Rutherfurd's rich prose paints a captivating portrait of family, romance, and adventure. "China: The Novel" is a firework, and I highly recommend it!
