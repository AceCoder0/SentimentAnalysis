Riveting, compelling and informative This is one of the best modern histories of China that I have read in 30 years. As an amateur scholar of international affairs and modern history and a professional businessman in the global economy, I can honestly say that I have read few books more wonderfully researched and written as this one. The author is simultaneously humorous, passionate, astute, sly, hilarious, serious, condemning and erudite! No one who hopes to be successful in the modern world can escape dealing with China in some fashion and no one who hopes to deal with China can truly do so without reading this amazing piece of work. Bravo.
