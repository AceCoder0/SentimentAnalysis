Well written snapshot of US and China relations in 2022 Kevin Rudd uses his experience to give us a great snapshot of the state of US and China relations in 2022.  He is an educated and intelligent writer who was formerly Prime Minister of Australia, resided in both China and the US, speaks both languages and is President and CEO of the Asia Society.  The book gives an in-depth assessment of the conflict between the two countries and what may be done to prevent an otherwise inevitable world war.  Like any snapshot of a moving target, things have already changed...the reason I took back a star.
