A Worthy Addition To His China Trilogy This book provided an excellent summation of how and why China is where they are at today. Mr. DiKÃ¶tter had a short window into files and archives that spell out how China embraced 'capitalist tools in socialist hands' in order to advance economically. They were never able to thread that needle well, and this book tells about the many financial disasters that occurred as they attempted to modernize.This book is a very worthy addition to his superb China trilogy.
