Wanted it to keep going! Always the sign of a great read... A delightful entertainment! Like all good historical fiction, you will learn a lot, while also getting enticed by the plot and the interplay of characters. You will get the basics of the Opium War, the Taiping Rebellion, the Boxer Rebellion, and more. You’ll learn about the smoking of opium, the operation to turn an adult man into a eunuch to serve in the Forbidden City, and the strange binding of girl’s feet to cripple them into desirable ladies for the wealthy. John Trader, Shi-Rong, Lacquer Nail, Mr. Liu, and the (real) Empress Cixi all leave lasting impressions on the reader. Highly recommended!
