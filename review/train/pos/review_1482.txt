How amazing the author organize the facts I am an Chinese from Shanghai , happened to read about this book from BBC and bought from amazon for kindle PC . I finished it in a week , none-stop reading .I am aware of most of the facts in the book . The author has amazing capability in organizing all those facts we can find from public media and some has been blocked in China . But we gotta ways to get to know it anyway .The author tells a very plain truth which we , as local Chinese , some time not even think about , that " there's god everywhere in China " , just like " big brother " .One thing I did not see and really eager to read about is how are those high ranking retired officials' views on  " god " thing .  Most of them have been long time with CP since 1930 and they has more insights on these topics . I guess it might be difficult for the author to find a chance to interview with them .I can image how pop it can be if it's been translated into Chinese , selling in HK .
