Great book After reading this book I feel like a came away with a much better understanding of how the ruling elite control China. The Communist Party system is controlled similar to fiefdoms and have different cliques vying for power, very similar to many other cleptocracies. The author has done his homework on who the major players are and where their power structure is based. I would definitely recommend this book to anybody interested in a deeper understanding of the CCP
