Great Read on the US Foreign Policy of the Far East for the Last 100 Years If you like history and have questions about our far east foreign policy in the last 100 years this is your book. I learned a great deal. I have no reason not to believe the reporting in this book although one could hope that at least a portion of it is not true. How top government officials and other experts could screw up so miserably is truly disturbing. I literally had to put the book down at times to let myself calm down over the reporting of one stupid decision after another. I'm a life long Republican so I suppose my negative view of FDR can be discounted by some. How he ever got to be viewed at one of the country's greatest presidents is beyond me. His know-it-all arrogance of cultures he did not begin to understand remind me of what is happening in the middle east today.
