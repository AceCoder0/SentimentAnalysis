Delicious epic. It took me days to devour this luscious saga, and I felt like I was living in 19th century China the whole time. The entire story is told through several characters who eventually interact, sometimes in surprising ways. OK, I didn't love the war maneuvers, but the story came alive when the eunuch told his life story and revealed what it was like in the palace; then I had a hard time setting the book down. Another grand epic in the tradition of Michener and Follett. Love Rutherfurd's books!
