A wonderful novel about The Middle Kingdom. Edward Rutherford has become my favorite writer of historical novels since James Michener.  This novel takes you through a crucial period of Chinese history and to a large extent helps understand how some of the problems we have today with China that have their origin in the nineteen century and the policies  of England, France, Russia and the United States.  I was also pleased to read a long historical novel that does not incorporate the mandatory pornography  found in modern narratives.  There is sex.  We know this because children are born, but the descriptions of their conception is not there.  A wonderful novel that will make many of us run to the library and do some more research about the Opium War The Taiping Rebellion, The Boxer Rebellion, missionaries, foot binding and much more.
