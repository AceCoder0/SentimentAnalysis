Freedom Convoy 2022 - what the world needs to know Peter Schweizer said that this is the most frightening research he has ever done--no wonder. I would buy the book for Chapter 7 alone: the Bush and Trudeau Dynasties--get the kindle/audible version and listen on the way to Ottawa. Stunning. I've been listening to the audible version--just released yesterday. If I could buy a copy for everyone I know, I would do it.
