The Chinese Communist Party:  Pulling back the curtain It's not possible to understand China without understanding the role and place of the Chinese Communist Party.  This book describes it.  The author notes that the Party "keeps the sinews of its enduring power off the front stage of public life and out of sight of the rest of the world," but in this book, he "peeks under the hood."He reveals the Party's ties with business; its control of personnel assignments throughout government, China's regions, business, and society; the Military Commission (the People's Liberation Army is the Party's army, not the nation's); and its control of the narratives of Chinese history.  Corruption and the Party's use of capitalism are also described.If you're going to China for anything more serious than a guided tour, this book is "must read."-30-
