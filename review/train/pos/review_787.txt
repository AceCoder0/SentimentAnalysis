A sobering, yet hopeful, prescription for managing the U.S.-China competition A masterful addition to the literature on U.S.-China relations. At times, an “outsider” (who nonetheless has spent much of his life on both sides of the relationship) is sorely needed to bring a critical disinterested perspective to a bilateral foreign policy problem that threatens to spiral out of control. Former PM Rudd does exactly that with this book.The best book on US-China relations I’ve  read in the past few years. Clear, concise, compelling. No overly rosy views offered here. PM Rudd provides a realist’s view of the US-China relationship, with a considerable dose of neoclassical liberalism thrown in for good measure. It’s a highly effective combination.
