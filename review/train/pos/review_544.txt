Blah Whatever is legal is not necessarily moral or safe. So, the author takes us on a ride to meet the usual suspects who try to enrich or empower themselves but ultimately become apologists and boosters of the Chinese dictatorial regime. Needless to say, there is plenty of hypocrisy to spread around, morality and pragmatic considerations are mostly absent, and the game is played at the highest echelons of power.The group of actors includes (X-or not) politicians who sometimes register as foreign agents (like Kissinger and Feinstein), relatives of people in power (like Hunter), relatives of wealthy Chinese (like Mc Connel and Chao), businessmen (like Gates, Chambers, Google dudes, Dorsey, Zuckerberg, etc.), financiers (like Dalio, Schwarzman, Fink, etc.), the NBA, and so on. The list is long.People are bought at lower levels as well, by financing universities and research facilities, journalists, etc.In a real world, you can't stop the mixing of people and exchange of ideas. What one could do is identify a narrow set of objectives and actively target excessive abuses, based on national security concern for example. As Lenin said, “When it comes time to hang the capitalists, they will vie with each other for the rope contract”. The speed and size of technology transfer to China, may facilitate what Lenin said in a commercial and military sense.In the meantime, one can remain cautious of Chinese spin narratives in the media by very powerful people and feel disgust on how leaders place their check book above national interest and almost always against their own long-term interest.Germany’s engagement and dependence on a power with imperial aspirations is the best example. Russia did a good job buying off German politicians ( E.g. Gerhard Schroeder) to take Germany energy hostage. Today, Germany effectively finances Russia’s war efforts in Ukraine. Chimerica’s entanglement may be more difficult to sort out. The writing is on the wall.
