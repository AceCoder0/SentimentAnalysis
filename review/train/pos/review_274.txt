After that 1993 visit with Senator McConnell, their partnership blossomed. From 2001 to 2011, Foremost received ten mammoth ships from Chinese state-controlled shipbuilders.96 When Elaine Chao became transportation secretary in the Trump administration in 2017, the relationship grew even more. As of July 2018, the Foremost Group signed a series of contracts with the China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC) to build ten more ships, including six of the massive 208,000-ton variety.97 The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but similar transactions with other entities buying these large vessels put the price tag over $50 million each. That puts the total deal in the hundreds of millions of dollars.98I would have never known the Chinese Influence on the Republican Party. Mitch McConnell is owned by China.
