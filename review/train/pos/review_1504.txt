Very Revealing Knowing little about China, I picked this up hoping to learn about modern China. It was quite informative and I enjoyed it throughout. Some parts were repeated frequently in many chapters, but I suppose that is just how important these parts are in China. The book may be a little long for some, but I do not regret purchasing this book. If anything, I want to learn more.
