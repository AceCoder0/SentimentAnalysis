A superb book about China’s rise and ambitions Rudd’s book is superb, and he knows China well, having met every since Chinese leader since Mao.  So this is a book not only about China’s rise, but also about Xi Jinping, and his role in the last decade and the next decade or so moving forward.  Rudd writes that we must see and understand China for what it is, not what we wish it to be.  This book, along with Kissinger’s book On China, are must reads.  Rudd’s wisdom and knowledge are invaluable.  Congratulations to Kevin Rudd - 5 stars ⭐️
