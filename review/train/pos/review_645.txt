The truth about Hunter and Joe Now that the New York Times has sanctioned the laptop, I hope I can say this is a great book that contains a disgusting revelation about some of our leaders and the inner mechanizations of global politics.  If the NYT has verified it, does that mean you're no longer a domestic terrorist if you read it?  Oops --- I think I hear helicopters.  Thank you once again, Peter Schweitzer.
