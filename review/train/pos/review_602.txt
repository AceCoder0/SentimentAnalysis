Our Government Is As Corrupt As Can Be When your own government is run by elites who become super wealthy from intimate relationships with hostile foreign elements, where can you turn?  This is a huge problem right now that is being exposed by books like this one.  Peter Schweizer and his team spent a year investigating the unethical ties that the elites in Washington, tech, media, Wall Street, etc. have with foreign enemies of the U.S.  The liberal media will continue to laugh these relationships off as conspiracy theories, but they are facts which can be easily proven by following the money trail.  And the money trail points right back at them too!Every American should read books like this because we're being lied to - from every area of government, the media, the medical establishment, private industry, and everyone else who is selling us and our country out for the usual culprits: Money and Power.
