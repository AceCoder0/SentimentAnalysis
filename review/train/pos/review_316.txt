Well-researched and cited Well-researched with hundreds of references for those who want to dig deeper. However, this author has already gone pretty deep with his research. This book is believable and enlightening. Now I understand why so many of our top politicians and business people refuse to bad-mouth China...Filthy (and I do mean filthy) rich people that are every-day names are highlighted so that a lot things now make sense...Highly recommend.
