Truth and wisdom from facts A concise riveting and eye-opening description of events and factors from the 19th and 20th century that is comparable in powerful revelation to Barbara Tuchman's "March of Folly".James Bradley has done a masterful job of piecing together an epic narrative behind the great struggle of the 20th century and perhaps the greatest blunder in all of recorded history - The Cold War. So many aspects of this tale were told to me over the decades in piecemeal fashion by various professors, teachers and friends. Some of which I found incredulous at the time, but over the years these facts and ideas form a bedrock of understanding. This work is a stunning and epic distillation that filled me anew with surprise, angst, joy and sadness.The Chinese have an old saying,"Seek truth from facts". The China Mirage is a remarkable contribution to this endeavor.
