Excellent perspective on China but the story has changed I traveled to mainland China for the first time in 1983 on a one day pass. Since then, I have done business there for years and continue to experience its evolution into a world power. McGregor story is well presented but now dated. It would be great to get a view of the country today from such true professional journalist.
