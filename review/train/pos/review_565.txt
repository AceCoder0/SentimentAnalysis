"The love of money is the route of ALL evil" 1 Tim 6:10 - Schweizer exposes that route! Red Handed by Peter Schweizer is a meticulously documented account of the depths of human compromise when access and participation to the full potential of the Chinese economic machine is dangled in front of them. Tragically, those who have succumbed to the juicy temptations of prestige, access and obscene profits are selling out their own values and ideals in exchange for a share in the tantalizing treasure. Blinded by greed, these American patsies cannot see how much their Faustian bargains will cost their American children or their grandchildren.
