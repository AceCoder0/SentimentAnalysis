Any forthright people leading today?? I gave the rating because I find Bradley's writing well researched and written.  I only read the book because of his father and his participation in the raising of the flag on Iwo Jima. A tribute to him.  It is very disgusting to me to read about the circumstances of this USA and its leaders of yesteryear.  My question, asked in fear, is what are present day leaders doing without consent of Congress??  This Congress is part of "for the people, by the people". What secret deals are done that may or may not protect us??
