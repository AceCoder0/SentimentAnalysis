They're ALL On the Take! Sadly, slush funds, envelopes under the door, influence peddling and the lust for power is hardly a partisan thing. BOTH sides are greedy for cash and political pull. There are a few principled pols but usually, because (like Trump) they already had money and power and being influenced to take MOAR(!) had less, if any appeal. The up & comers in our congress and bureaucracies are easy marks. And, it pays because few if any have ever paid a price for selling out upper or middle-class working and entrepreneurial Americans for cash.
