China comes alive Rutherford’s prior novels cover vast portions of history and the roles of people in succeeding generations.  This one is a bit different as it only covers about seventy years.  Those seventy years might have a bearing on China’s views about the West (particularly Great Britain) as they start with The Opium  War and Chinese humiliation lasting a century.  The characters are rich and varied  with  the portrayals of Mei-Ling and Lacquer Nail  worthy of being the subjects of a novel on their right.
