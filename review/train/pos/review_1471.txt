A Look Inside a Political Institution The subtitle might throw you off. This is not so much a book about individual personalities, although individual stories provide the basis for analysis. It's more about the institutional workings of a massive, nimble, confusing, calculating organization that influences the daily lives of over a billion people. This book will give you a sense of the magnitude of exactly what the Chinese Community Party can do, how its role has changed, and simply how much you don't know about it. McGregor develops a clear opinion from the first page, and builds upon that image in every subsequent anecdote. Thus, the chapter of the People's Liberation Army stands not so much for itself, but how it reflects the dominance of the party.Along these lines, the book is relatively light on historical detail. It's more about individual stories and how they reflect greater trends. Don't look to this book for any comprehensive narrative. Think of it as a look inside the mind of a Chinese leader. If you are not already familiar with the history of the PRC, you could use some background. But this book will help put trends in context, giving you a basis for further studies about communist rule. Before you study isolated facts and specific leaders, it helps to have a book like this that gives you a picture of the underlying structure that defines and drives the party as a whole. The content itself is perhaps not even the book's strength. Rather it is the gripping style, intended to paint a picture and tell a story rather than lecture. Think of McGregor as a tutor, trying to teach you so you really understand. Ultimately, this is his great success: proving convincingly that the current party in power on the Mainland is persistent, flexible, and completely pervasive.
