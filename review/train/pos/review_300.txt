unbelievable and a must read for any US Citizen For almost a decade I have said many times to friends, family and colleagues that I believed many US businessmen and politicians had sold their souls to China.  I had no idea of accurate that statement was until reading this book.It’s unconscionable to me how we let businesses,universities and politicians get away with enriching themselves at our expense.  I don’t know if are still the point of no return but we had better wake up soon and put a stop to it. I’ll never understand why the media ignores the situation.
