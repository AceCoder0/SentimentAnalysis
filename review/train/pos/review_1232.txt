There's More to China than We Thought We Knew Excellent rebuttal to common wisdom related to our misunderstanding a sleeping Tiger.  Bradley does an excellent job of pursuing the facts, regardless of how inconvenient they may be.  For over 50 years the US has made strategic decisions in Asia in a fantasy land filled with mirages.  The only criticism I have of the book is a reference to B-52s being launched from islands during WWII--they were B-29s.  Not sure how that slipped by the proof-readers.
