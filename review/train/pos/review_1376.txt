Good History, Shaky Conclusions The author’s premise in this non-fiction work is that cultural ignorance on the part of American leadership in the early 20th century led to repeated conflicts in southeast Asia (World War II, Korean War and Vietnam War), which were entirely avoidable.Starting with Theodore Roosevelt and extending through his cousin Franklin Roosevelt, the author lays out a historical narrative that reflects very poorly not only on the Presidents, but also on most of his advisors.  The author repeatedly brings up the fact that the Roosevelt family fortune (along with many others in eastern American high society) was rooted in the 19th century opium trade with China.  This created something of an affinity for the country, without any actual knowledge or experience, leading to a complete misunderstanding of the cultural and political landscape.While I was somewhat familiar with the issues leading up to the Pacific theater of World War II, the more detailed and extensive backstory was unknown to me.  The same goes for my knowledge of the Chinese Civil War.  These parts of the book were very helpful and educational.  I can’t say, however, that I fully support the author’s underlying conclusions.Certainly, the outbreak of the Pacific hostilities could have been delayed for a period, but to suggest that war with Japan could have been entirely avoided is at best naïve.  And to promote the idea that the United States should have allied with Mao Zedong and Ho Chi Minh is pretty blatant historical revisionism and not realistic given the tenor of the times.  I think we can all agree that many historical events could and should have been avoided, however doing so in hindsight, especially employing vastly different social, cultural and political mores, is an exercise in futility.
