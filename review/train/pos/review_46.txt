Grand, Magnificent - A Travel in Time! I was whisked away to the celestial kingdom while reading Rutherford's book. It's an amazing mix of fiction, drama and history. It has raised so many curious questions about the great dynasties of China! I loved this book, even though it was around 800 pages, I wish it were longer. Just a pleasure to read!!
