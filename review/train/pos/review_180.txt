It grew on me At first I was disappointed. Unlike Rutherfurd's other historical novels, this one deals with only a short section of the history of China, the mid to late nineteenth century. I was hoping for his usual broad sweep through the millennia, especially with a country like China, whose written history goes back further than most. However, this novel goes in depth into the psyche of China, presented through the eyes of several main characters from a wide spectrum of Chinese society, as well as from the viewpoint of several Westerners. It took a while to get into the book; the Chinese characters were more relatable than the Englishman, John Trader, whose story forms the first section. But in the end I gave it 5 stars as Rutherfurd's research is meticulous and well-rounded. I feel I understand China better now.
