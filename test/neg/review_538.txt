And the point being? And if no point…then what’s the point? So, you are here to tell us that we people are not perfect, as is. Wow, a shocker. “What we pay attention to grows”. What’s the point of investigating our fallible human nature that we all equally share, lest we want to expand it? How about trying to expand  all the good in us instead, that we also equally share. The only way to do that, is to start investigating its opposite in you. Dear authors, if you really want to make a difference in our fallible human world…work with your self, on yourself, above all else. Never mind what others are doing. That’s only a distraction from what you should be doing for the common good in all and for all.
