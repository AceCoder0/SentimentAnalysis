Opinionated Revisionist History I was very disappointed in this book, especially since I thought Bradley's book "Flags of Our Fathers" was excellent. This book, however, presents a very skewed view of history that makes highly selective use of facts to bolster the author's case, which is essentially that we got snookered into fighting Japan in WWII by China.He grossly minimizes Japan's aggression and inhuman atrocities and implies that they were merely doing what they had to do was a reaction to U.S. foreign policy. This view completely ignores the absolute brutality of their expansionist ambitions that led to their occupation of China and Korea.The second major problem I had was his glorifying of Mao Zedong and some sort of great, righteous leader that we failed to recognize. Sure, Chiang Kai-Shek was a fascist who pulled the wool over the eyes of most Americans, but that's pretty much common knowledge now, not some sort of "hidden history." And when Bradly presents a China that would have been so much better off if we had aligned with Mao rather than Chiang, it borders on complete nonsense. All one has to do is look at how Taiwan turned out compared to China under Mao. Taiwan ultimately became a democracy and an economic powerhouse, while China under Mao turned into a regime far more repressive than Chiang's ever was, and such an economic disaster that tens of millions of people died of starvation.I don't know what the author's agenda is in writing this book, but his warped view of history does not stand up to the facts.
