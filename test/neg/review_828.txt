Informative, Provocative, but has flaws I enjoyed reading the  colorful descriptions of the two Roosevelt Presidents and the wise men who had influenced their decisions. I learned that the recent serge of  anti-China  pro-Japan sentiments  dated back to the Presidency of Theodore Roosevelt (1901-09) , just  two decades after the signing of the Chinese Exclusion Act. We know that the Roosevelts and many of the most prominent  American families  made their fortune  dealing with  illegal opium trade in China.  Teddy Roosevelt despised China  and was enamored with Japan under Meiji rule, as it was the first Asian nation to become westernized.  Roosevelt secretly  orchestrated a ”Japanese Monroe doctrine” to set up Japan as the  keeper of Asia  to counter  Russia.  When Japan went to war with Russia in 1904  over the control of Korea and China's  northeast  provinces (Manchuria) , Roosevelt acted as a peace broker. affirmed Japanese control, and secretly gave Korea to Japan for which he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.  Subsequently Japan turned around to bite the hand that fed it  and the tide turned . The United States under President Franklin  D. Roosevelt acted heroically  and payed a heavy price to protect China as well as  American  Pacific interests from Japanese aggression.  Bradley went on to show that history kept on repeating itself, and  similar misjudgment of succeeding administrations  had led to the Korean War and Vietnamese War. Let's not forget what US intervention has done to the Middle East  (see: A World in Disarray by Richard Haass 2018). Finally China, after a century of calamities ( foreign invasion ending in colonization, revolutions, Japanese occupation,  a whole scale civil war, ,economical failure, famine , domestic political persecution and international isolation ) had  miraculously risen to the top.  However, a strong China is  unacceptable to Washington. The Pentagon warriors are repeating the mistake of Theodore Roosevelt, that is: militarizing and pitting Japan, a  nation with a long record of war crimes, against China who had never invaded another country in its long history.  Millions of Chinese, Japanese, Koreans and Vietnamese had died as the result of policy failures during the  past century. In the present nuclear age, another mistake could mean the end of civilization.  Overall, I  appreciate Bradley's rare inside look and cynical criticism of  world leaders, but I  disagree with his assessment of Chiang Kai-shek which is based solely on Stilwell's viewpoint.  Most Chinese persons I know , including some Communists, consider  Chiang a true patriot.  As successor to Sun Yat-sen,  founder of  Republic of China , Chiang  led the revolutionary army on a victorious Northern Expedition  to unite a China torn by warlords.  Chiang was not ignorant, having had a classical Chinese education and had studied  at the Imperial Japanese Military  Academy  in Tokyo. Sent by Sun to Moscow to study the Soviet political and military systems ,Chiang quickly realized  that the Soviet model of government was not good for China , a view  which Chinese Communists later recognized as well.  Chiang  was a ruthless dictator and warmonger, but not  on the  level of Hitler or the Japanese mad dogs. Chiang's downfall was caused by : (1) Japanese invasion, (2) his obsession to eliminate communism at all cost and  (3) a chaotic and corrupt system he inherited.  Having learned a bitter lesson from his failure on the China mainland,  Chiang and his son/heir Chiang Ching-kuo, did serious reforms  to eliminate corruption and to improve the livelihood of people on Taiwan.  With American aid and Chinese assets : money taken  from the mainland (including my father's retirement  pension) and manpower ( educators, scientists, industrialists , financiers and  politicians )who followed Chiang to Taiwan,  the KMT had accomplished  the " Taiwan Miracle.”  They  fed a large army and refugee (1.2 million versus 6.2 million local population), educated the young , myself included, achieved land reform , industrialization , economic boom and  made Taiwan one of Four Asian Tigers.(See : The Generalissimo: Chiang Kai-shek and the struggle for modern China. by Jay Taylor 2011).H.
