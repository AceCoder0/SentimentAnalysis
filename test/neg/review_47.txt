Disapointing Book from a Favorite Author Edward Rutherford has been a favorite author of mine for many years, as he has written about the history of several countries seen through the eyes of multiple generations.  This book, which I expected to begin in ancient China, instead begins in 1837, and spends many chapters on the opium marketing by primarily English/Indian business people.  The story "hops" around, told through the eyes of various people.  It is sometimes hard for a reader to follow.  An inordinate amount of pages is spent on the eunuch who works at the palace.All in all, I will most likely not read another Edward Rutherford book!
