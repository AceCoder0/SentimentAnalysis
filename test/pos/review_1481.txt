Excellent behind-the-scenes look at "corporate China" This is a well-written glimpse of the behind-the-scene influence of the Chinese communist party in ostensibly "private" companies that have drawn so much foreign investment. Essentially, the power of the Party relies on the power to pick who runs the firms. Although a company may have a Western-style governance structure, with a board of directors including Westerners, those rules and decision-makers will be quickly ignored when the company's interests contradict those of the Party. The author notes one instance when the Party reassigned the CEOs of several cell phone companies, making CEO of Company A CEO of Company B, etc., and CEO of Company B CEO of Company A, in a game of musical chairs --- and the CEOs had no say in the matter and were surprised by the move. The author aptly states that it would be like the CEO of AT&T being forced one day to become the CEO of Verizon, and the Verizon CEO assuming the lead role at AT&T. Although China is a clearly a rising economic force, lost in the hype of China Inc. and the praise of privatization is the reality that the Party remains very much in control. Highly recommended.
