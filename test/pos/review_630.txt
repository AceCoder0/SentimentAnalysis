An encyclopedia of corruption (arguably, nearly treason) by a cabal of disreputable elites. The author does a painstakingly impressive, comprehensive job of chronicling the ways so many elites across so many disciplines (politics, business, higher ed) have leveraged their ties to China to advance their wealth and/or socialistic philosophy with apparent disregard for the consequences for America and denial of China's deplorable record on human rights.  The depth of Schweizer's research makes for a torrent of details which, in turn, makes for a "slower" read.  And the sheer breadth of the corruption and hypocrisy is certainly dispiriting.  But that said, this is an important and illuminating volume.
