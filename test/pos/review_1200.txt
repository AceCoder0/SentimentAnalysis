Great read We seem to always get the correct version after the fact.  Why is it that the USA makes so many glaring mistakes with foreign countries?  Is it a Harvard thing?  And, can this string be broken?  How can we get the correct message out when so many career politicians differ on a particular course of action when dealing with other countries?  Too many questions and still no good answers.....Maybe, just maybe the answer is to keep our noses out of other countries politics?
