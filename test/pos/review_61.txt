A HIT!!! Rutherfurd at his best.  Another 5 star review.  I have ALL of his books and have never been disappointed with any of them.  Not only is he a good story teller but he sets each novel in a wonderful country and time period that you can actually learn some true history.  What a fantastic writer!!!
