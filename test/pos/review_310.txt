Want to know how America was sold to China, read this book! It's heart-wrenching to see how the American elites, who became unbelievably wealthy using the American way of doing business, American freedom and liberties, have sold out the country to China who is undeniably bent on destroying everything the U.S. stands for. Utter lack of gratitude to the country that "raised" them. Their greed knows no bounds!
