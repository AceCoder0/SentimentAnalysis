Excellent summary of why there are troubled waters ahead... The authors aptly describe how China's Communist system "capitalized on capitalism" over the last 25+ years to stoke their military's immense buildup.  They now face a precipitous fall -- for all the reasons cited.  They will not go down quietly, and the entire world should worry.  This is a clarion call to be ready and my worry is that we are not.  Highly recommend for anyone who wants to better understand what drives China "National Rejuvenation" strategy and how they plan to achieve it, no matter the cost.
