The Communist Party is everywhere.... like God A readable book explaining how the Communist Party rules China in the 21st century is long overdue. Richard McGregor delivers on the promise of the subtitle to unveil the secret world of the party. Many people dismiss the idea that communism still has traction, assuming that "a Starbucks on every corner is a sign of political progress." It's not so: "The Party is like God. He is everywhere. You just  can't see him,"a Beijing university professor tells McGregor. My favorite part so far is about the the red telephones on the desks of ministers, editors of party newspapers, CEOs of state-run companies through which the party issues its instructions. There are few enough of these red machines that the phone numbers have only four digits and when the phone rings, you'd better answer.
