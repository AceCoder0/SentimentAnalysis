Peter’s BEST Work Ever!!! Let me make this VERY clear—“EVERYTHING” stated below in my review comes from Peter’s book (& my scholarly review of that book’s content):Every American needs to READPeter’s new book. As Peter documents such corruption in his fabulous book, the more it confirms (according to Peter) that Americans are SO VERY TIRED of these politicians on both sides of the isle, Big Tech executives (& other corporate American executives) “selling out” our country, especially after so many brave Americans (& our allies) have “GIVEN THEIR LIVES” [aka have been killed/murdered] in their fight to preserve America’s freedoms.As Peter states in his book, how can these “sell-outs” (that Peter specifically documents in the book) even show their faces in public?!!! Peter states that we need “REAL Congressional hearings” & an “impeachment of Biden & Harris”, & “indictments of both high-level executives & especially politicians”, like “Pelosi” as well as any & all of their criminally involved “family members”, who sold out America to our enemies—-especially the Chinese government (CCP). [Emphasis added].PETER ASKS in his book,“WHY are these politicians so focused on Jan 6th, & not:•the ORIGIN of the CV-19 virus that he believes most likely emanated from 1 of the 2 (Level 4) labs in Wuhan [note: Peter in this book is in exact agreement with  Dr. Francis Boyle who wrote the U.S. Biological Weapons Act] ; &/or•the BILLIONS of DOLLARS that the Chinese government has spent to buy out America’s politicians—[i.e., Peter states that 31 million dollars went to the Biden family alone, including Joe Biden who funneled the money through his various family members like his son?”]. [Emphasis added].Peter further writes that 31 million dollars the Biden family has received from the CCP, Russia, Ukraine, etc., does NOT even include “the 1/2 BILLION that the CCP gave Hunter Biden through CCP shell  companies”.[Emphasis added].Thank you Peter for all your hard work on this EXCELLENT piece of American literature, & for your documentation & thoroughness of this book.
