Very enlightening book on how we got into a war with Japan In 1940 Japan had gotten two thirds of its oil  and much steel for military and industrial use from California ports and the balance from the Dutch East Indies. President Roosevelt had hoped to check Japan's aggressive take over of Korea, Manchuria northern China by partnering with General Chiang Kai-shek and the American educated  Soong family (including his wife, Madame Chiang) that supported him.  However, Chiang's main interest was in fighting Mao Zhedong and his army of peasants. The Soong family spent its energies convincing Washington that Chiang was winning battles against the Japanese when the reality was just the opposite.  Because of the Chinese Exclusion Act of the 1883 there were hardly any Chinese on the East Coast who could provide Washington with the real story of Chiang's corruption, brutality and an army that was forced into service and totally incompetent and unmotivated.Roosevelt's strategy was to concentrate on the war in Europe and appease Japan by continuing to supply it with much needed oil.  However, the book goes on to explain how a group of State Department officials conspired to embargo the oil which left Japan no choice but to capture the oil fields of the Dutch East Indies. The US Navy fleet anchored in Pearl Harbor thus had to be eliminated.  In Japan's eyes the American Embargo was the first blow in the Pacific war.James Bradley presents this story in fascinating detail in this well written book.
